# Appearance.Transcripts
Coquin-de-Chien (John Beaudoin Sr) Transcripts

The purpose of this repo is to place AI generated captions in one location for easy searching. How this repo will change will depend on how well it is working for our purposes.

**Note:** *Not all appearances will have transcriptions (due to bandwidth).*

# Organization

Transcripts:

- [appearances](appearances) - Appearances.

Other folders:

- [tools](tools) - tools and scripts

## Conventions

In each transcript "top" folder, there will be a new folder for each stream. These folders will typically start with the date, include where the appearance was and a link to the appearance.
