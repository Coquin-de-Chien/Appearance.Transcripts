WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.600
You let Nick Fuentes back up.

00:01.600 --> 00:02.400
Yes.

00:02.400 --> 00:02.900
Absolutely.

00:02.900 --> 00:04.800
A white supremacist anti-Semite.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.560
Yeah, as long as he doesn't break the rules.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.000
Well, those are breaking the rules.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.960
No, being having views, having thoughts in your head

00:11.960 --> 00:13.240
is not against the law.

00:13.240 --> 00:14.160
What about saying the rules?

00:14.160 --> 00:15.000
On his show.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.120
If you say things on the platform that violate the platform.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.760
And if you promote your show and you say them on your show?

00:21.760 --> 00:26.400
Well, if I started spewing white supremacy stuff in front of you,

00:26.400 --> 00:28.920
and I then tweeted a link to the show,

00:29.000 --> 00:30.120
you'd be happy with that.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.280
I'm not saying I would be happy with it,

00:31.280 --> 00:33.120
but I wouldn't want you banned from X for that.

00:33.120 --> 00:33.400
Really?

00:33.400 --> 00:35.400
So I could look down the barrel of this camera

00:35.400 --> 00:38.760
and say, I think all black people should be thrown out of this country.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.120
Watch how they clip this one.

00:40.120 --> 00:40.920
Well, no.

00:40.920 --> 00:43.600
Zooby knows how the internet works.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.480
Yeah, Pierce, it's a crazy thing.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.080
I would like to know who espouses those views.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.360
That's the beauty of freedom of speech.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.840
So someone will clip it, right?

00:52.840 --> 00:54.160
And I could say that.

00:54.160 --> 00:57.800
And then I could tweet a link to this show, to promote the show.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.120
And you would think I should stay on X.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.480
Yes, I want to put your right to free speech.

01:01.480 --> 01:02.720
Wow, wow.

01:02.720 --> 01:04.360
That's not free speech, it's hate speech.

01:04.360 --> 01:05.640
No, it's free.

01:05.640 --> 01:06.560
Hate speech.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.120
I mean, I know Pierce is approaching this discussion

01:09.120 --> 01:11.800
from the British perspective, much like a Canadian

01:11.800 --> 01:14.120
might be approaching it from the Canadian perspective.

01:14.120 --> 01:17.600
Hate speech, it's not bloody recognized under the First Amendment

01:17.600 --> 01:20.520
as a restrictive method, Pierce.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.720
Freedom of speech specifically exists to protect views,

01:23.720 --> 01:24.960
and people espousing views.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.960
But there are six different criteria excluded

01:26.960 --> 01:28.320
from the First Amendment.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.720
Not one of which is hate speech, Pierce.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.040
This is where you might've got, there's defamation,

01:33.040 --> 01:36.880
incitement, a criminal discourse, criminal activity.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.520
What's it, fraud?

01:38.520 --> 01:41.440
There are six carved out criteria.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.480
In America, one of them is not hate speech.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.200
Imagine saying immigrant go home,

01:47.200 --> 01:49.360
as in as much as it's unpopular to say,

01:49.360 --> 01:52.080
becomes hate speech worthy of being unbanned.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.440
So when people tell Pierce Morgan to go home

01:54.440 --> 01:56.440
because nobody needs his censorship

01:56.440 --> 01:59.240
and anti-second amendment perspective in America,

01:59.240 --> 02:02.480
that would be hate speech, ban them from Twitter,

02:02.480 --> 02:05.360
and so that nobody can tell Pierce Morgan to go home

02:05.360 --> 02:07.240
because of his un-American views,

02:07.240 --> 02:08.280
and I'm not saying this, by the way,

02:08.280 --> 02:09.960
but I'd like to know who would be saying it

02:09.960 --> 02:11.440
if people were saying it about me.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.960
Go back to Canada, because what they'd be saying.

02:13.960 --> 02:17.200
Including child pornography, including defamation,

02:17.200 --> 02:18.320
including all sorts of things.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.440
You can't famously go into a theater and shout,

02:20.440 --> 02:22.640
fire, including all sorts of things,

02:22.640 --> 02:24.200
but not hate speech, Pierce.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.040
Right at the answer.

02:25.040 --> 02:25.880
Sure, but you can say that.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.320
So there are lots of restrictions already.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.360
Look, there are people who think that I engage in hate speech.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.080
There's people who think that you engage in hate speech.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.600
Hate speech is a very subjective,

02:33.600 --> 02:35.440
it's an extraordinarily subjective term.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.560
And if anyone who has ever said anything,

02:37.560 --> 02:39.680
you just know that anyone can say anything.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.480
I don't think you can directly call to violence.

02:41.480 --> 02:42.640
It's an amazing thing.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.920
Hate speech is very subjective.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.240
So anyone can say anything.

02:45.240 --> 02:48.080
No, Pierce, we already established that.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.880
My goodness, Zuby's doing good.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.200
Right. No.

02:52.080 --> 02:55.080
Anyhow, that's to say a shout out to Zuby for,

02:55.080 --> 02:56.240
not keeping its composure.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.000
It's not like he was under attack.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.840
It is very easy to get distracted and flustered

03:00.840 --> 03:04.160
when you're on a platform as big as Pierce Morgan.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.840
You know, having that talk over you.

03:05.840 --> 03:07.840
I thought that was a great clip to start with

03:07.840 --> 03:10.920
because it might be relevant for today's discussion.

03:10.920 --> 03:12.120
I don't know if we're gonna get in trouble

03:12.120 --> 03:14.920
for talking about the George Floyd situation,

03:14.920 --> 03:18.360
but before we do, let's just make sure

03:18.360 --> 03:19.280
that we're live everywhere.

03:19.280 --> 03:23.400
I was glitching on stream yards.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.160
I was trying to say and put in the chat,

03:26.160 --> 03:28.480
went for a jog this morning in the rain.

03:28.480 --> 03:29.720
It's beautiful.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.800
It would not let me send that message four times.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.120
An error occurred, wait a moment and try again.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.720
Then I do mic check and the mic check goes through.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.240
Then I put in, went for a jog in the rain this morning.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.880
It was beautiful, an error occurred, wait.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.200
And then we're back to chat.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.000
So let's make sure that we're live everywhere

03:46.000 --> 03:48.720
before we get into this because I hesitated

03:48.720 --> 03:51.720
on the thumbnail and the caption

03:51.720 --> 03:53.040
or the title to describe this.

03:53.040 --> 03:56.040
I don't want to be accused of clickbait.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.760
I don't want to be accused of anything

03:58.760 --> 04:02.480
that would impune what I pride myself on my integrity.

04:03.280 --> 04:07.120
And I ran the title by our guest and he says,

04:07.120 --> 04:10.720
I'm gonna pronounce his name the way the French do, Jean Baudouin.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.440
Although it's Jean Baudouin.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.480
I don't want to mischaracterize what we're gonna discuss today.

04:15.480 --> 04:16.600
I don't want to oversell it.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.320
I don't want to make it what it's not.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.720
I don't want anyone saying clickbait, exploitive rubbish.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.520
You're gonna meet Jean Baudouin, senior.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.520
And we're gonna talk about what he says he's discovered

04:29.520 --> 04:32.720
and what he believes is a strong indication

04:32.720 --> 04:35.920
that George Floyd's death certificate was modified

04:35.920 --> 04:38.640
to conceal what was the initial indication

04:38.640 --> 04:39.520
of cause of death.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.320
Now, when someone else is out there saying,

04:42.320 --> 04:47.320
I question the official narrative lawsuits, defamation,

04:47.320 --> 04:50.560
oh, whatever it is, hate speech, you can't, you can't do that.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.960
That's a, you can't question the narrative

04:52.960 --> 04:54.800
without getting deplatform sanctions.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.560
Who, it doesn't matter, we're doing it today.

04:59.520 --> 05:02.680
And what I was going to say is that for those of you

05:02.680 --> 05:04.800
who don't know me, Viva Fry, Montreal litigator

05:04.800 --> 05:08.800
turned Florida rumbler, when I go a day without streaming

05:08.800 --> 05:13.400
or making a vlog, I feel like I have not accomplished anything.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.520
Even though technically I might have accomplished 10 other items

05:16.560 --> 05:18.240
which are equally, if not more important,

05:18.240 --> 05:20.720
a day without streaming, a day without video,

05:20.720 --> 05:22.760
a day without, oh, you know,

05:22.760 --> 05:24.720
communicating with the world feels like a day loss.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.040
Although I did communicate with our locals community,

05:27.040 --> 05:29.240
vivavarnslaw.locals.com.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.520
We're gonna catch up and we got some news.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.920
So what we're gonna do today,

05:31.920 --> 05:34.200
we have a guest, John Baudouin, senior.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.760
You might know him from his research and work

05:36.760 --> 05:40.120
on the COVID question, COVID stats, COVID data.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.000
You're gonna know him based on what we're gonna talk about

05:42.000 --> 05:44.800
today, a little bit of that, George Floyd.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.800
After the interview, I'm gonna continue on on Rumble.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.320
So about 45, 50 minutes in, we're gonna end on YouTube

05:50.320 --> 05:52.280
and Rumble and go over exclusively at Rumble.

05:52.280 --> 05:55.960
If you're watching on vivavarnslaw.locals.com,

05:55.960 --> 05:56.800
am I good there?

05:58.160 --> 05:59.000
Are we good here?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.600
We are good here.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.720
Then we're gonna have our after party

06:01.720 --> 06:03.120
on vivavarnslaw.locals.com.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.640
So that's the order for the day.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.200
Shall we get going?

06:08.200 --> 06:09.040
Six minutes in?

06:09.040 --> 06:10.360
Good.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.760
Mr. Baudouin?

06:11.760 --> 06:13.960
Esque vousette plait, monsieur.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.560
That's French for, are you ready?

06:15.560 --> 06:16.400
He's ready.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.240
Okay, I'm bringing him in.

06:17.240 --> 06:18.960
Three, two, one.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.160
John, sir, how goes the battle?

06:21.160 --> 06:23.080
Oh, going very well, actually.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.560
Winning on all fronts.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.920
So I appreciate the pronunciation of my name

06:26.920 --> 06:29.000
and I will say, Jean-Paul Props parfons,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.360
say I won't dare to not teach me.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.040
Baudouin, for those of you who don't,

06:33.040 --> 06:33.880
might have survived.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.840
It is definitively a French origin,

06:35.840 --> 06:37.720
but there's a lot of, you know,

06:37.720 --> 06:41.040
of many multi-generational who have a French name,

06:41.040 --> 06:42.720
last name, who don't speak French,

06:42.720 --> 06:44.480
much like I have Freihite as the last name,

06:44.480 --> 06:45.720
but I don't speak German.

06:45.720 --> 06:46.560
Although in Yiddish,

06:46.560 --> 06:47.920
it means the same thing, freedom,

06:47.920 --> 06:49.720
in all Germanic languages.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.440
John, there's gonna be a lot of people.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.760
I suspect who might be watching now

06:52.760 --> 06:54.760
who have no idea who you are.

06:54.760 --> 06:55.680
There's gonna be a lot who do,

06:55.680 --> 06:57.280
because you've been a pivotal,

06:57.280 --> 06:59.040
but not necessarily the, you know, the,

06:59.040 --> 07:02.720
what do they call them, the headline name in the COVID

07:02.720 --> 07:05.120
research battle that has been ongoing.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.320
Many people are gonna know who you are,

07:06.320 --> 07:07.680
but for those who don't,

07:07.680 --> 07:09.520
let's do the 30,000 foot overview.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.040
We're not gonna delve into too much history today.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.800
Maybe some before we get into the present,

07:13.800 --> 07:15.320
but who are you?

07:15.320 --> 07:19.080
Well, I'm 59, so I was born in 64.

07:19.080 --> 07:22.080
It gives a relative view of how I grew up

07:22.080 --> 07:22.880
and when I grew up.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.200
So you had the Vietnam War ending,

07:25.200 --> 07:29.000
as I was a child growing up in the 70s.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.160
And then got into some trouble as a kid,

07:33.160 --> 07:35.520
nothing major, just as kids do.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.320
Boys, we used to run around free.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.560
Now everybody's kind of locked up

07:39.560 --> 07:42.400
and on their electronic devices.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.720
And then I found school somehow.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.840
You know, I thought it was cool to get A's.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.240
So I did really well in high school.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.320
I got a full scholarship.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.320
I came in engineer and then I didn't like that.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.120
So I ended up in sales.

07:55.120 --> 07:59.760
So my career is large contract sales.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.560
Very strategic, big deal.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.000
I'll just say the guidance control assistant

08:05.000 --> 08:06.280
for the Trident nuclear missile,

08:06.280 --> 08:08.840
the Polaris missile that pops out of submarines.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.640
I put together the deal for all the design software for that.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.320
It's netted over a billion dollars

08:13.320 --> 08:16.280
and it spanned Raytheon, General Dynamics,

08:16.280 --> 08:18.880
Lockheed Martin, Honeywell.

08:18.880 --> 08:22.280
And the prime contractor was Draper Laboratory

08:22.280 --> 08:24.080
in Cambridge where MIT is.

08:24.080 --> 08:27.120
So my career was really high tech conversations

08:27.120 --> 08:31.600
where I had to translate among financial people,

08:31.600 --> 08:33.480
legal and contracts people,

08:33.480 --> 08:37.640
really super bright engineers doing crazy designs.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.600
So I just communicate well.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.240
And then I raised the family,

08:42.240 --> 08:44.200
raised three boys on my own,

08:44.200 --> 08:46.200
divorced a long time ago,

08:46.200 --> 08:48.280
full custody for years.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.520
And when COVID hit,

08:50.520 --> 08:52.360
I was, I'll just tell your audience,

08:52.360 --> 08:55.120
I had lost my son a few years before COVID

08:55.120 --> 08:56.640
in a motorcycle accident.

08:56.640 --> 08:59.160
And so I sat on the couch depressed

08:59.160 --> 09:02.320
and when COVID hit my middle son said this is all BS,

09:02.320 --> 09:05.040
I was like, no, you gotta take it seriously, Charlie.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.080
You know, people are dying.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.640
So I looked into the data.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.960
I wanted to be a good dad

09:09.960 --> 09:13.440
and I found out they were lying about a lot of stuff.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.840
They changed the file.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.960
When I looked at it, I wrote to the CDC,

09:16.960 --> 09:18.400
I said, you have some math errors

09:18.400 --> 09:20.960
in your 2014 through 2018 data.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.400
And when they wrote, they didn't write back.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.920
They took the file down for 36 hours

09:25.920 --> 09:29.120
when they put it back up, they changed the data.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.760
They changed historical data

09:30.760 --> 09:33.320
to meet the narrative they were pushing in 2020.

09:33.320 --> 09:34.840
I can't prove any of it,

09:34.840 --> 09:37.640
but I know it happened to me and that set me off.

09:37.640 --> 09:38.880
And...

09:38.880 --> 09:40.600
Oh sorry, so when you say you can't prove it

09:40.600 --> 09:42.880
because you didn't have screen grabs before and after,

09:42.880 --> 09:44.320
but you know that you saw it with your,

09:44.320 --> 09:47.560
it's the gaslighting, like the memory holding.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.720
If you don't screen grab it,

09:49.720 --> 09:51.280
you don't even, you don't have a record of it,

09:51.280 --> 09:52.120
but you know what happened.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.840
And people will think you're crazy.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.560
I don't think anyone's gonna think you're crazy though.

09:55.560 --> 09:58.640
We've seen how they've deleted and stealth edited

09:58.640 --> 10:00.960
in real time to fit the narrative.

10:00.960 --> 10:04.600
So you get heavily involved in just COVID research

10:04.840 --> 10:08.480
and tracking the data with your interest,

10:08.480 --> 10:11.160
obsession and area of expertise.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.000
Yes, yes.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.680
I actually went to law school for a year at 56 years old.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.480
And before I wanted data to the school,

10:18.480 --> 10:21.080
I said, I'm not taking any vaccine by email.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.560
And they wrote back, don't worry, you're over 30.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.360
You don't have to take a vaccine.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.560
So that incorporates as part of the contract

10:27.560 --> 10:28.920
as an inducement, right?

10:28.920 --> 10:30.160
I go for a year and then they say,

10:30.160 --> 10:33.640
we have a vaccine mandate and they throw me out.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.360
So now I have a lawsuit against the school.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.360
I have a lawsuit against the governor and federal court

10:37.360 --> 10:39.760
for deprivation and rights.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.800
I've got a lot of stuff going on.

10:41.800 --> 10:42.720
But yeah.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.920
Yeah, just the chat said, I'm a little low.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.040
I've upped my volume a little bit.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.080
So we're gonna see if this is better now.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.240
I don't know that we need to get into the COVID stuff,

10:52.240 --> 10:54.360
although it might be incidental to,

10:54.360 --> 10:56.200
it will incidentally touch on what's going on here.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.640
So you get heavily involved in that world

10:58.640 --> 11:00.600
of the interwebs for COVID.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.360
You know what the likes of Jessica Rose.

11:03.440 --> 11:07.160
And the number of the other experts who were analyzing

11:07.160 --> 11:09.280
the data in ways, analyzing the data,

11:09.280 --> 11:11.160
identifying weaknesses in the data

11:11.160 --> 11:13.440
and calling out the people on it.

11:13.440 --> 11:17.120
And you've established quite, I say in the milieu,

11:17.120 --> 11:21.040
a very, very respectable reputation for having done that.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.840
And with that might be a subject for another day entirely,

11:24.840 --> 11:28.480
but let me, so how does it get into George Floyd

11:28.480 --> 11:33.000
and what is your business in looking into George Floyd?

11:33.000 --> 11:36.080
Well, first of all, I don't even want to talk about this,

11:36.080 --> 11:37.800
but it needs to be talked about

11:37.800 --> 11:41.120
because the truth is just so important to me.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.720
And there are personal reasons I've had signs

11:44.680 --> 11:46.760
from God, if you will.

11:46.760 --> 11:51.160
So I have through public records request,

11:51.160 --> 11:52.800
all the Massachusetts test certificates

11:52.800 --> 11:53.880
for the last nine years.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.280
Somebody else got them from Minnesota.

11:57.280 --> 12:01.080
And so after a year of analyzing Massachusetts,

12:01.120 --> 12:05.840
that person and she wants to remain anonymous,

12:05.840 --> 12:07.520
alerted me that they had them.

12:07.520 --> 12:10.320
And then another guy in New York City

12:10.320 --> 12:12.920
and I started analyzing those as well.

12:12.920 --> 12:14.440
If I may, I might interrupt you.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.520
I'm going to not do it too often

12:15.520 --> 12:17.120
just to get clarification on points.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.760
So you have nine years of death certificate data

12:19.760 --> 12:21.840
from Massachusetts.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.080
Yes, and now Minnesota.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.880
And you had this because that was part

12:24.880 --> 12:26.560
of what you were looking into for the COVID deaths

12:26.560 --> 12:29.720
to track pre COVID post COVID, I presume, right?

12:29.720 --> 12:30.560
That's correct.

12:30.560 --> 12:33.560
You said that a 70 year old girl died from COVID.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.560
And I thought, you know, for everything I know,

12:35.560 --> 12:38.080
there's no way a healthy seven year old dies from COVID.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.400
So I got the death certificate

12:39.400 --> 12:41.320
and it actually said she died of COVID.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.040
But then I found another record.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.080
She reacted to the vaccine in five minutes,

12:45.080 --> 12:46.840
vomited for eight to 10 hours.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.080
They waited a couple of weeks, gave her another vaccine.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.000
She had stomach pain.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.720
She was dead in four days.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.520
And on her death certificate, they wrote COVID.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.840
It's the only thing they wrote in part one.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.400
So there's massive amount of fraud being committed

12:58.440 --> 13:02.080
by Massachusetts on official death records.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.600
And that's what set me off to do all the analysis.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.920
Is the name of that seven year old girl public?

13:06.920 --> 13:10.120
I don't want to violate privacy.

13:10.120 --> 13:13.560
Yeah, I've said it many times in Massachusetts law,

13:13.560 --> 13:15.200
I can say it or name is Cassidy.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.720
And if you look at anything I've done,

13:16.720 --> 13:18.200
you can find the records.

13:18.200 --> 13:22.600
It's also the first chapter in my book is named Cassidy.

13:22.600 --> 13:27.440
It's similar to Trista Martin, the family

13:27.480 --> 13:31.360
about who daughter passed away after the jab.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.920
Sean Hartman and the most recent one,

13:33.920 --> 13:38.840
which was Shawna Carroll, her daughter was given two jabs

13:38.840 --> 13:41.720
within three weeks of each other, fell violently ill

13:41.720 --> 13:46.120
and passed away and then they mark it as a COVID death.

13:46.120 --> 13:50.040
So you get this one particular case, which I imagine is

13:50.040 --> 13:54.000
that's enough to set off an otherwise rational person

13:54.000 --> 13:55.280
for a very long time.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.880
Was that the first one that you discovered

13:56.920 --> 13:58.600
that set you off or was that one of the ones

13:58.600 --> 14:01.080
that you discovered during your research?

14:01.080 --> 14:02.800
That's the one that caused me to file eight

14:02.800 --> 14:05.640
public records requests, which is the Massachusetts

14:05.640 --> 14:09.920
state version of a FOIA and seven of them were denied.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.840
The one that came through was the entire

14:11.840 --> 14:13.200
death certificate database.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.680
Now when I say I have the death certificate database,

14:15.680 --> 14:18.240
a certificate is just a piece of paper with a state seal

14:18.240 --> 14:20.360
on it, it's got a few things filled out.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.200
In the database for every record,

14:22.200 --> 14:24.320
that's every decision, every dead person,

14:24.320 --> 14:28.160
there are 315 different columns on a spreadsheet.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.680
So I have the middle names, first names, last names,

14:30.680 --> 14:32.520
parents names, where the parents are from,

14:32.520 --> 14:34.960
the manner of death, all the causes,

14:34.960 --> 14:38.080
the burial plot, I got everything for everybody.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.200
That's it.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.800
I guess that is, I never appreciated

14:42.800 --> 14:44.680
that that's public information.

14:44.680 --> 14:47.520
And so how many names are on this list?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.280
How many entries?

14:49.280 --> 14:50.920
500,000, roughly.

14:50.920 --> 14:54.120
500,000 over nine years, you said.

14:54.120 --> 14:54.960
Yes.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.680
From my own personal curiosity,

14:56.680 --> 14:59.600
what's the apportionment of the nine years,

14:59.600 --> 15:00.440
so the four years?

15:00.440 --> 15:03.960
It's about, yeah, it's about 59 to 60,000 per year

15:03.960 --> 15:07.440
until you get to 2020, in which there were about 8,800

15:07.440 --> 15:10.760
extra deaths in nine weeks from mid-March to mid-June

15:10.760 --> 15:14.040
for the big COVID wave that they called the COVID wave.

15:14.040 --> 15:16.680
I could get into what that really was.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.600
I interviewed a medical examiner for three and a half hours

15:19.600 --> 15:21.120
who worked in Boston.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.600
And we reviewed hundreds of death certificates

15:23.600 --> 15:26.400
and she told me what they were doing during that time.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.880
There's a lot I could get into on the COVID stuff.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.880
If you want to hit the George Floyd stuff first,

15:30.880 --> 15:32.840
it's up to you where you want to go.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.160
Yeah, well, this might segue us into,

15:37.160 --> 15:38.400
this is how you got the information.

15:38.400 --> 15:42.280
So you get nine years of data for Massachusetts.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.480
How does it come to be that you get the nine years of data

15:45.480 --> 15:47.360
for Minnesota?

15:48.240 --> 15:51.240
Well, as people talk to each other in our circles,

15:51.240 --> 15:54.920
like you said, I know Jessica Rose and a bunch of people

15:54.920 --> 15:57.160
and call it the movement, the truth movement.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.640
We just want truth.

15:58.640 --> 16:02.160
And somebody pointed me to someone in Minnesota.

16:02.160 --> 16:06.240
I contacted that person and they wanted the analysis

16:06.240 --> 16:09.520
that I've done in Massachusetts, also done in Minnesota.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.520
She has the same unident, or excuse me,

16:12.520 --> 16:16.720
not de-identified record, unredacted records that I have.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.560
Maybe 150 different columns.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.200
There's a few things missing, but still enough.

16:21.200 --> 16:25.320
So she, I'll just say she,

16:25.320 --> 16:28.520
she actually pointed out the George Floyd death certificate

16:28.520 --> 16:29.640
to me and said, look at it.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.480
Look at it, something's funny with it,

16:31.480 --> 16:33.360
that look at the, look at the UCOD,

16:33.360 --> 16:35.560
which means underlying cause of death,

16:35.560 --> 16:38.240
which is a terrible name for the root cause of death.

16:38.240 --> 16:41.120
The thing that started the causal chain that caused death.

16:41.120 --> 16:45.600
Like, you know, this caused not be able to breathe

16:45.600 --> 16:48.160
cause anoxic brain injury caused death.

16:48.160 --> 16:52.080
It's like what was the root cause, the original cause.

16:52.080 --> 16:55.000
And I kind of didn't pay attention

16:55.000 --> 16:57.360
because I was so involved in the data

16:57.360 --> 17:00.520
that I didn't want to get involved in George Floyd.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.200
And then finally, I was like, you know what, she's right.

17:03.200 --> 17:07.760
And I then understood how the CDC operates

17:07.760 --> 17:12.760
where the states send the written death certificates

17:12.880 --> 17:17.400
to the CDC, or the records I should say, not certificates,

17:17.400 --> 17:18.760
but the database.

17:18.760 --> 17:21.600
So the information is in English words

17:21.600 --> 17:25.360
that are sent to the CDC, cause A, cause B, cause C, cause D.

17:25.360 --> 17:27.600
That's part one of the death certificate.

17:27.600 --> 17:29.160
And it's in backwards time order

17:29.160 --> 17:30.920
with A being the immediate cause.

17:30.920 --> 17:31.760
Go ahead, sorry.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.840
Now question, the CDC is the center for disease control.

17:36.200 --> 17:39.280
Why would, or why would death certificates

17:39.280 --> 17:41.720
go through the CDC as a rule to begin with?

17:43.120 --> 17:44.760
Well, I don't know.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.320
I don't think it's a rule that they have to,

17:46.320 --> 17:48.960
but the CDC has software called Transax

17:48.960 --> 17:51.440
and another program called Acme.

17:51.440 --> 17:55.360
And they run it through the Transax Acme software

17:55.360 --> 18:00.360
to convert the words, it's not AI, but you can say it's AI.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.400
It's understanding the words

18:02.400 --> 18:06.440
and converting them into international cause of death codes,

18:06.440 --> 18:08.120
ICD-10 codes.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.640
And those ICD-10 codes are how everybody in the world

18:11.640 --> 18:13.160
tracks causes of death.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.040
When they say heart disease is up,

18:15.040 --> 18:18.240
they're saying the I4s are up.

18:18.240 --> 18:21.200
It's the I is for circulatory system

18:21.200 --> 18:23.640
and four is like a lot of cardio stuff.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.640
So they're not telling you the cardiac stuff is up.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.280
They're telling you anything coded with an I4 is up,

18:29.280 --> 18:30.480
it is high.

18:30.480 --> 18:35.480
And so to create, to apply these codes as the CDC does,

18:36.680 --> 18:40.560
it actually creates a single point of failure in a system.

18:40.560 --> 18:43.880
You know, I'm a systems engineer, electrical engineer.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.920
And so this being a single point of failure,

18:45.920 --> 18:47.720
if the CDC has anything wrong,

18:47.720 --> 18:49.960
then everything is wrong from there on.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.440
So the state sends it to the CDC for coding.

18:52.440 --> 18:56.200
The CDC sends it back to the state with the codes applied.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.480
Okay, clarify that.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.080
The state, well, let's take George Floyd

19:00.080 --> 19:03.160
just as the concrete example, he dies.

19:03.160 --> 19:05.720
The state sends what to the CDC for coding,

19:05.720 --> 19:08.880
like what does the document form whatever entry

19:08.880 --> 19:10.400
that they sent to the CDC?

19:10.400 --> 19:12.720
Yeah, so every state law, you know,

19:12.720 --> 19:13.800
all the state laws are different,

19:13.800 --> 19:15.960
but most of the states have a law

19:15.960 --> 19:20.960
where a death record must be created within,

19:21.560 --> 19:23.400
it's like usually 48 hours.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.560
So they create a record, not everything's filled out.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.120
I mean, they haven't done the autopsy,

19:27.120 --> 19:28.440
they haven't done a lot of stuff.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.760
They get the person's name,

19:29.760 --> 19:32.240
they get the date and time of death

19:32.240 --> 19:35.920
and the physician attending or the medical examiner.

19:35.920 --> 19:39.480
Medical examiners get the bodies usually within 24 hours.

19:39.480 --> 19:42.120
So they create the record

19:42.120 --> 19:43.320
and then they start filling it out.

19:43.320 --> 19:44.680
When it gets to a certain point,

19:44.680 --> 19:46.880
they get the causes of death, they write it,

19:46.880 --> 19:48.720
then they send it to the CDC.

19:48.720 --> 19:49.680
And what's it?

19:49.680 --> 19:53.640
It is a database on a spreadsheet

19:53.640 --> 19:56.120
that is in the case of Massachusetts,

19:56.120 --> 19:58.160
350 in different columns.

19:58.160 --> 20:01.040
It has race, gender, you know, date of birth,

20:01.040 --> 20:03.200
date of death, everything in there.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.480
Okay, and now concretely,

20:06.480 --> 20:09.960
I keep one thing Minnesota, the state is Minnesota,

20:09.960 --> 20:12.480
the city's Minneapolis, a Minneapolis,

20:13.320 --> 20:16.320
what does the state send to the CDC

20:16.320 --> 20:20.320
in the initial report of George Floyd's cause of death?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.280
But I can't say definitively,

20:22.280 --> 20:25.080
I can just say that whatever was there

20:25.080 --> 20:27.040
doesn't seem to be what's there now

20:27.040 --> 20:30.560
because the software will run

20:30.560 --> 20:34.520
on what was sent to the CDC originally by Minnesota.

20:34.520 --> 20:39.400
And it will look at the last cause listed in part one

20:39.400 --> 20:42.360
as the UCOD, usually.

20:42.360 --> 20:46.320
Now, there are probably something in the algorithm

20:46.320 --> 20:48.240
within the transax ACME software

20:48.240 --> 20:50.280
that pulls something else out.

20:50.280 --> 20:53.280
I don't know the details.

20:53.280 --> 20:56.520
The manual is online, it's a reference in my book

20:56.520 --> 21:00.400
that transax ACME user manual.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.880
You can go to the CDC website and find it

21:02.880 --> 21:05.200
or you can find my book and get the reference.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.960
We're gonna, I'm glad you haven't put that link in yet,

21:08.960 --> 21:10.320
but I will.

21:10.320 --> 21:13.840
It's now a good time to bring this up, John.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.240
Sure, absolutely.

21:15.240 --> 21:18.680
Now, so this is, you're gonna have to walk us through this,

21:18.680 --> 21:19.840
but explain what's going on here.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.280
I can zoom in if you would like me to.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.120
Yeah, that's great.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.040
Wow, now you did a great job.

21:25.040 --> 21:29.120
Okay, so this is not a death certificate.

21:29.120 --> 21:32.240
The spreadsheet is 315 columns wide

21:32.240 --> 21:34.320
and I have to drag my fingers across the sheet

21:34.320 --> 21:36.320
many times to get to the right column.

21:36.320 --> 21:39.760
So what I did is I created this template

21:39.760 --> 21:44.400
and all I do is type in his share file number

21:44.400 --> 21:47.360
for everybody's assigned a unique number

21:47.360 --> 21:50.880
and it populates this visual representation

21:50.880 --> 21:52.960
of George Floyd's death certificate.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.520
If I may ask you now, so you created this template,

21:55.520 --> 21:57.480
is that to say you could pull up this template

21:57.480 --> 21:58.760
for every one of the entries

21:58.760 --> 22:01.440
of the nine years of data that you have?

22:01.440 --> 22:02.280
Yes.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.120
Okay.

22:03.560 --> 22:07.760
Any one of probably Minnesota has about 420,000

22:07.760 --> 22:09.400
deaths certificates in the database?

22:09.400 --> 22:11.880
This is, I mean, this stuff makes me,

22:11.880 --> 22:13.200
makes my head short circuit.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.000
This is like creating an Excel spreadsheet

22:15.000 --> 22:16.120
that extracts the data,

22:16.120 --> 22:17.720
populates it into this predetermined thing.

22:17.720 --> 22:18.920
So you have the date of death,

22:18.920 --> 22:21.920
the gender or the sex surname city

22:21.920 --> 22:24.560
and then you got the ACME universal cause of,

22:24.560 --> 22:26.760
or underlying cause of death, sorry, all this stuff.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.800
So you have these, we're gonna show this

22:28.800 --> 22:29.640
because you got another one here

22:29.640 --> 22:31.240
which with the name blacked out

22:31.240 --> 22:33.240
and we'll get to that in a second.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.320
So you get the data, you've created this template

22:35.320 --> 22:40.120
to simplify the otherwise non-digestible data

22:40.120 --> 22:43.920
in the CDC's database?

22:43.920 --> 22:44.840
Yes.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.480
It's just an easier visual representation.

22:47.480 --> 22:49.840
It helps me a lot in efficiency

22:49.840 --> 22:51.800
of looking through data as well.

22:51.800 --> 22:52.640
Okay.

22:52.640 --> 22:53.480
And now we'll go through the obvious stuff here.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.840
You got the date of death is May 25th, 2020.

22:55.840 --> 22:59.960
Floyd, Minneapolis, X42, ACME, UCOD.

22:59.960 --> 23:00.880
This I know is critical.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.480
What does that mean?

23:02.480 --> 23:04.800
If you scroll down to the bottom, I can read it.

23:05.920 --> 23:06.760
All right.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.920
So X42 is accidental poisoning by

23:08.920 --> 23:13.600
and exposure to narcotics and psycho dysleptic hallucinogens,

23:13.600 --> 23:15.200
not elsewhere class but.

23:15.200 --> 23:19.240
So they have a specific code for that underlying cause of death.

23:19.240 --> 23:22.480
That actually works for math.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.720
There are acute cocaine overdoses,

23:24.720 --> 23:26.920
acute meth overdoses, it works for all of them.

23:27.080 --> 23:31.560
It's poisoning by, you know, a drug.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.200
If you know this offhand,

23:33.200 --> 23:36.560
how many of those do they get in a year in Minnesota?

23:36.560 --> 23:37.720
Well, on this particular one,

23:37.720 --> 23:41.000
on the bottom of the right side, it says,

23:41.000 --> 23:46.000
there you go, 348 records in Minnesota were the UCOD.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.360
In 2020?

23:48.360 --> 23:49.480
In 2020, along.

23:49.480 --> 23:50.320
Okay.

23:50.320 --> 23:55.120
348 were the underlying cause of death was X42,

23:55.160 --> 23:58.320
which is accidental poisoning by exposure to narcotics

23:58.320 --> 23:59.680
or psycho dysleptics.

23:59.680 --> 24:00.880
Don't know what that means hallucinogens,

24:00.880 --> 24:01.760
not elsewhere classified.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.160
Okay.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.480
I'm going to come back up.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.600
This is where I should come, John.

24:06.600 --> 24:07.520
Sure, sure.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.920
So the important thing to look at here is part one.

24:10.920 --> 24:11.960
Part one is causes.

24:11.960 --> 24:15.560
Part two is other significant conditions contributing.

24:15.560 --> 24:19.640
A lot of times they put like smoking, obesity,

24:19.640 --> 24:22.400
things like that, usually go in part two.

24:22.400 --> 24:26.240
If something was in the causal chain of events

24:26.240 --> 24:28.720
that caused death, it's usually in part one.

24:30.560 --> 24:34.160
So what you're looking at here is cause A,

24:34.160 --> 24:35.800
which is the immediate cause.

24:35.800 --> 24:40.200
And this probably should have been broken up to be ABCD.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.640
And by the way, for your audience,

24:42.640 --> 24:44.400
different states and different people,

24:44.400 --> 24:48.000
especially doctors, physicians that are not medical examiners,

24:48.000 --> 24:49.080
they do a horrible job.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.840
Sometimes they write these things backwards,

24:50.840 --> 24:51.960
they're all over the place.

24:51.960 --> 24:55.280
So in this case, it was a medical examiner.

24:55.280 --> 24:56.440
So it should be right.

24:56.440 --> 24:57.960
Cardiopulmonary arrest,

24:57.960 --> 24:59.680
complicating law enforcement,

24:59.680 --> 25:02.320
subdual restraint and neck compression.

25:02.320 --> 25:05.520
Now, cardiopulmonary arrest means his heart stopped

25:05.520 --> 25:06.720
and he stopped breathing.

25:06.720 --> 25:10.080
And if you fall off a building and you die

25:10.080 --> 25:12.200
by hitting the ground, your heart stops,

25:12.200 --> 25:14.880
but there's no point in putting it on there.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.640
It's put on these death certificates

25:17.640 --> 25:21.920
because it was something leading up to the heart stop

25:21.920 --> 25:23.960
and then the heart finally stopped.

25:23.960 --> 25:26.680
And the other issue before we go on

25:26.680 --> 25:30.840
is that these are counted as heart-related issues.

25:30.840 --> 25:35.080
This is, well, they say heart deaths have increased.

25:35.080 --> 25:38.400
I-46, which is what this is.

25:38.400 --> 25:41.400
It is on very many death certificates where the heart,

25:41.400 --> 25:42.280
there was no problem.

25:42.280 --> 25:44.080
It's just their heart stopped.

25:44.080 --> 25:47.520
The I-469 Cardiopulmonary arrest unspecified.

25:47.520 --> 25:48.400
There it is.

25:48.400 --> 25:51.840
So that's another thing we can talk about some other time.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.360
So people spouting data.

25:54.360 --> 25:58.200
All the PhDs, MDs, and everybody looking at CDC data,

25:58.200 --> 26:00.160
they think they're looking at accurate data

26:00.160 --> 26:02.280
that has to do with the heart, but it's not.

26:02.280 --> 26:04.720
So let's get back to George Floyd.

26:04.720 --> 26:07.760
So they're saying that the neck compression killed him.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.560
It was the immediate cause, his heart stopped.

26:09.560 --> 26:10.320
That's what did it.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.160
That's it.

26:11.160 --> 26:13.440
And by the way, he also had, in part two,

26:15.480 --> 26:16.840
atherosclerosis.

26:16.840 --> 26:20.520
Arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease,

26:20.520 --> 26:24.280
fentanyl intoxication, recent amphetamine use,

26:24.280 --> 26:26.480
does that mean contemporaneous with the death,

26:26.480 --> 26:29.240
or does that mean like within the last week?

26:29.240 --> 26:32.760
The latter, more likely, otherwise they would have written

26:32.760 --> 26:36.800
intoxication, which means it was in his blood at the time.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.920
Which we have with the fentanyl intoxication

26:38.920 --> 26:40.000
in the last place right before.

26:40.000 --> 26:40.840
Okay.

26:40.840 --> 26:43.800
They also use the word acute very often to describe

26:43.800 --> 26:46.040
like acute fentanyl intoxication means

26:46.040 --> 26:47.480
it happened in the moment.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.600
I'm surprised it doesn't say acute here.

26:49.640 --> 26:54.240
So, you know, yeah, I don't know how they call it

26:54.240 --> 26:57.760
the UCOD when it's, first of all, it's in part two.

26:57.760 --> 27:01.920
So the software, Acme and Transac software by the CDC,

27:01.920 --> 27:04.440
how did it possibly read this?

27:04.440 --> 27:07.760
Now, this is the death certificate as it currently is.

27:07.760 --> 27:11.320
How did it, and when I say currently, I mean, as of November,

27:11.320 --> 27:13.480
was the last time I got this database.

27:13.480 --> 27:18.480
So how did they get the X42 to be the acne use

27:19.600 --> 27:24.600
the COD from that software if it's in part two,

27:25.000 --> 27:28.560
and part one is that he died from the knee on the neck?

27:28.560 --> 27:30.440
I mean, the underlying cause of death

27:30.440 --> 27:32.240
is the root cause of death.

27:32.240 --> 27:36.240
Something, in my opinion, and I don't, you know,

27:36.240 --> 27:37.720
you can't know anything for sure

27:37.720 --> 27:41.320
unless you dive into the code of the Acme Transac.

27:42.400 --> 27:47.360
But how does the death certificate as it is now

27:47.400 --> 27:50.520
represent an X42 as a UCOD?

27:50.520 --> 27:52.120
It doesn't.

27:52.120 --> 27:57.120
So I believe, and I originally tried to just,

27:57.480 --> 27:59.200
I just wanted to get the information

27:59.200 --> 28:01.520
to the defense attorney and get out of it.

28:01.520 --> 28:04.400
Cause I don't wanna deal with the George Floyd situation.

28:04.400 --> 28:07.920
I have more things, I don't want people shooting arrows

28:07.920 --> 28:08.860
at me for this.

28:10.560 --> 28:15.000
But the original death certificate, I seriously doubt,

28:15.000 --> 28:16.320
had that as cause one.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.680
That's also kind of a weird phrase that I've never seen.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.520
And by that as cause one, you mean,

28:21.520 --> 28:23.240
cardiopulmonary arrest.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.720
See, I'm just trying to make sure I even understand

28:25.720 --> 28:26.880
what it says.

28:26.880 --> 28:29.920
It sounds like he had a heart attack which complicated.

28:29.920 --> 28:30.840
It's not a heart attack.

28:30.840 --> 28:31.920
That's the problem.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.760
Everybody thinks this is a heart attack.

28:33.760 --> 28:35.760
All this means is that your heart stopped.

28:36.720 --> 28:38.760
That's a cardiac arrest, right?

28:38.760 --> 28:40.080
Your heart stopped.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.080
That's all I mean.

28:41.080 --> 28:41.920
I'll read it this way then.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.160
Heart stopped complicating law enforcement.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.280
I don't even read that as heart stopped

28:46.280 --> 28:48.280
because of law enforcement subdual.

28:49.400 --> 28:50.680
Unless I'm reading it wrong.

28:50.680 --> 28:55.680
I know it is not written the way I have ever seen a physician

28:55.920 --> 28:58.720
or medical examiner write the death certificate.

28:58.720 --> 29:01.840
And I've looked at probably tens of thousands by now.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.280
So now after a year and a half.

29:03.280 --> 29:04.680
And to understand this data,

29:04.680 --> 29:07.200
this is the template that you've compiled from the data

29:07.200 --> 29:11.320
on the CDC that was sent back from the CDC to the state.

29:11.320 --> 29:12.160
That's correct.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.360
So someone hypothetically could say,

29:14.360 --> 29:17.440
well, the CDC got the coding, the UCOD wrong,

29:17.440 --> 29:20.400
sending it back and the original recommendation,

29:20.400 --> 29:25.240
for lack of a better word, would have been suffocation

29:25.240 --> 29:28.520
or what a subdual net compression.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.160
So someone's gonna say,

29:30.160 --> 29:32.160
how do you know where that error came from?

29:32.160 --> 29:33.840
Is it coming from the CDC sending it back

29:33.840 --> 29:34.960
with the wrong code?

29:34.960 --> 29:38.880
Or did someone change it and only change part of it?

29:38.880 --> 29:40.480
Well, that's where the defense attorney

29:40.480 --> 29:42.840
really needs to look into this.

29:42.840 --> 29:46.240
It's very serious if the original death certificate

29:46.240 --> 29:49.480
from the medical examiner who did the autopsy

29:49.480 --> 29:51.880
originally had the fentanyl toxication

29:51.880 --> 29:53.760
as the root cause of death.

29:53.760 --> 29:57.320
And then somebody changed it after it went back to the state

29:57.320 --> 29:58.680
in order to meet a narrative.

29:58.680 --> 30:01.320
They're trying to push on the people.

30:01.320 --> 30:03.720
That really needs to be looked into by a defense attorney.

30:03.720 --> 30:06.480
Just the fact that X42 is there.

30:06.480 --> 30:08.680
It's still there and they haven't fixed it

30:08.680 --> 30:10.880
to match what the words say.

30:10.880 --> 30:14.960
See, the X42 on this same record as cause A,

30:14.960 --> 30:16.160
they don't match.

30:17.080 --> 30:20.200
And now typically they would batch.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.000
Yeah, I mean, go to the right

30:22.000 --> 30:23.760
and let's see that other one, right?

30:23.760 --> 30:24.560
To explain what we have here.

30:24.560 --> 30:28.120
This is another individual who died

30:28.120 --> 30:29.640
and the underlying cause of death

30:29.640 --> 30:31.480
is the same as George Floyd.

30:31.480 --> 30:32.440
This is same year.

30:32.440 --> 30:37.200
So we got different city certifiers.

30:37.200 --> 30:41.240
So this is the only one out of the other one

30:41.240 --> 30:45.160
out of the 348 that does not have

30:45.160 --> 30:50.160
in the written cause A, B, C, D fentanyl overdose.

30:51.040 --> 30:54.760
So this is like George Floyd's in that it is an aberration

30:54.760 --> 30:57.440
and 348 records.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.000
I look through every single one of them

31:00.000 --> 31:04.600
and every single one has fentanyl intoxication

31:04.600 --> 31:06.920
as the last cause.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.400
I'm just comparing, you got fentanyl intoxication

31:09.400 --> 31:11.400
for both of these in part two.

31:11.400 --> 31:12.320
In part two, yep.

31:12.320 --> 31:13.960
These are the, that's the only one.

31:13.960 --> 31:16.920
I didn't, and I only found this yesterday, David.

31:16.920 --> 31:21.160
The only other one in the, in the of the 348 that has a

31:22.440 --> 31:25.800
X42 without it being in the part one cause of death.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.360
What does foreign body ask?

31:27.360 --> 31:30.520
I mean, I know what it means, but does that mean choking?

31:30.520 --> 31:32.800
I could, yeah.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.160
Yes.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.280
Yeah, he aspirated something that's not supposed to be

31:37.280 --> 31:39.960
in your lungs into his, into his lungs.

31:39.960 --> 31:43.960
Maybe he breathed in a, well, I don't want to speculate.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.400
No, I mean, I could just imagine maybe,

31:45.400 --> 31:47.080
I don't know if that would be the same description

31:47.080 --> 31:49.720
for choking on your vomit as an OD, for example, but.

31:51.320 --> 31:52.760
Yeah, they usually write that.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.880
And then we got here, injury, description,

31:56.880 --> 32:00.120
ingested, injected illicit drugs.

32:00.120 --> 32:02.480
And if we go to injury description,

32:02.480 --> 32:05.360
this decadent experience, a cardiopulmonary arrest

32:05.360 --> 32:08.040
while being restrained by law enforcement officers.

32:08.040 --> 32:13.040
So 348 all have X42 and they are demonstrable X42.

32:13.520 --> 32:14.640
So that's, that's.

32:14.640 --> 32:15.480
Yeah.

32:15.480 --> 32:17.880
That has that as the number one cause of death

32:17.880 --> 32:18.960
in the description.

32:18.960 --> 32:22.480
If you, I don't know if you loaded the other pages,

32:22.480 --> 32:26.480
but the other pages, oh, you did, wow.

32:26.480 --> 32:27.320
Here we go.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.160
All right.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.400
I'm going to bring it out, hold on like this.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.960
There you go.

32:32.920 --> 32:35.760
Okay, now tell us what's going on here.

32:35.760 --> 32:37.440
So what you're looking at,

32:37.440 --> 32:39.480
well, I just wanted to show you that the,

32:39.480 --> 32:43.040
there's not an ME listed on George Floyd's record.

32:43.040 --> 32:43.880
I don't know why.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.480
It says medical examiner case.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.880
Why does it not say medical examiner case?

32:47.880 --> 32:49.160
Was that removed?

32:49.160 --> 32:51.320
Why is the medical examiner not signing up

32:51.320 --> 32:54.160
for having written this death certificate?

32:54.160 --> 32:57.680
You would think that the seriousness of the case,

32:57.680 --> 32:59.800
somebody would put their name to it, right?

32:59.800 --> 33:01.360
Put their, their profession to it.

33:01.360 --> 33:02.440
Can I scroll up to the top?

33:02.440 --> 33:05.600
Who do we see up here as the certificate surname?

33:05.600 --> 33:07.320
What does this mean, Baker in?

33:07.320 --> 33:09.240
Oh, his last name is Baker.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.080
Oh, okay.

33:10.080 --> 33:10.920
It wasn't.

33:10.920 --> 33:11.960
He doesn't bake donuts, no.

33:11.960 --> 33:12.800
Okay.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.440
So that's not, no, but I thought,

33:14.440 --> 33:17.200
I thought that was maybe the, the certifier of the city.

33:17.200 --> 33:20.240
So he is, he is the, now it doesn't say there.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.920
I could look it up actually.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.800
Whether or not he's a medical examiner

33:23.800 --> 33:26.320
or a physician attending or a nurse practitioner.

33:26.320 --> 33:27.920
Okay.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.520
And so this data that we're seeing here

33:29.520 --> 33:32.960
is compiled from George Floyd's data from the CDC.

33:32.960 --> 33:35.760
The, the, every line is a different person.

33:35.760 --> 33:37.640
These are records of every different person

33:37.640 --> 33:38.680
where you see on that line,

33:38.680 --> 33:39.720
cardiopulmonary arrest,

33:39.720 --> 33:40.920
complicating law enforcement,

33:40.920 --> 33:42.360
subdual restraint, neck compression.

33:42.360 --> 33:44.240
That's George Floyd where the arrow is.

33:44.240 --> 33:45.080
Okay.

33:45.080 --> 33:45.920
If you go to the next,

33:45.920 --> 33:47.640
go to the next slide, I'll show you some.

33:47.640 --> 33:48.480
Okay.

33:48.480 --> 33:50.840
So this is cause A, cause B, cause C.

33:50.840 --> 33:54.600
What's in red is where it says fentanyl.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.480
Now, because,

33:56.480 --> 33:59.480
remember I said the UCOD is the last one listed.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.560
So if there's only something listed in A,

34:02.560 --> 34:04.040
then that's the last one.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.640
And all of those that are in red

34:05.640 --> 34:08.400
with the red bar under A on the left,

34:08.400 --> 34:10.840
those all say either fentanyl or,

34:10.840 --> 34:12.840
or math or something like that.

34:12.840 --> 34:14.520
The, the red squares,

34:14.520 --> 34:16.920
the three red squares to the right,

34:16.920 --> 34:19.200
you see two of them are in cause B.

34:19.200 --> 34:20.560
And it says fentanyl.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.480
That's the last one listed.

34:22.480 --> 34:24.280
And then you go out to C,

34:24.280 --> 34:25.760
there's one there,

34:25.760 --> 34:27.000
the last cause listed,

34:27.000 --> 34:28.960
fentanyl toxicity.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.440
So I'm showing you that every one of those other

34:31.440 --> 34:36.000
348 records are correct in that the UCOD

34:36.000 --> 34:39.120
is the last cause listed on the death record.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.680
And on the screen right now,

34:40.680 --> 34:42.520
there are probably 10, 20, 30,

34:42.520 --> 34:46.760
there's over 30 people listed out of the 348.

34:46.760 --> 34:47.600
I didn't want it.

34:47.600 --> 34:49.040
And oh, there's the next screen.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.720
I'm not going to give you the whole 348,

34:51.720 --> 34:54.280
but all of these were in cause A,

34:54.280 --> 34:56.280
which was the last one listed.

34:56.280 --> 34:59.960
So the software was working fine.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.440
I think somebody intervened in the software

35:02.440 --> 35:03.840
and changed something.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.000
That's what I'm saying.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.320
Okay.

35:08.280 --> 35:12.480
And this has, has this been mentioned publicly yet?

35:13.280 --> 35:14.600
I don't really know.

35:14.600 --> 35:18.680
No, it's only, there were probably four or five of us

35:18.680 --> 35:20.880
who knew this for the last month.

35:20.880 --> 35:24.280
I tried to contact a very well-known doctor.

35:24.280 --> 35:27.200
I didn't understand what side of the case he was on.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.520
So we had a confusing conversation at first.

35:31.240 --> 35:33.320
And then, and we figured it out.

35:33.320 --> 35:35.440
It's like, all right, we shouldn't talk.

35:35.440 --> 35:40.080
And then I just want the truth to go to the defense attorney

35:40.080 --> 35:43.680
because everybody's got their opinions.

35:43.680 --> 35:46.520
The worst this was was involuntary manslaughter

35:46.520 --> 35:51.520
because Floyd was in the care of the officer

35:51.520 --> 35:53.560
who had a legal duty to act.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.040
And determine his status.

35:56.040 --> 35:59.200
That that's the worst it could be as involuntary manslaughter.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.920
I don't see how it can be anything else.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.120
Yeah, I'm just Googling right now.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.760
I think Derek Chauvin is now pro se.

36:05.760 --> 36:07.000
I think he's representing himself.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.080
Yeah, yeah, I read that.

36:08.080 --> 36:11.080
So I don't even think he's got an attorney anymore.

36:11.080 --> 36:14.120
So that's, and what can it be done to obtain

36:14.120 --> 36:15.840
in as much as it could potentially exist,

36:15.840 --> 36:19.080
the original data information sent from the state

36:19.080 --> 36:22.400
to the CDC, which would confirm or contradict

36:22.400 --> 36:24.240
what the CDC sent back to the state.

36:25.520 --> 36:28.320
I mean, you know the law better than I do,

36:28.320 --> 36:32.240
but if I were George, if I were Chauvin,

36:34.640 --> 36:38.440
or as attorney, I would ask the state for the evidence.

36:38.440 --> 36:42.080
I mean, it's number one, it's Brady evidence, right?

36:42.080 --> 36:45.560
And secondly, you should be able to get it on a state FOIA.

36:45.560 --> 36:48.560
And then thirdly, you should get it on a federal FOIA

36:48.560 --> 36:52.560
because the record was in the hands of the CDC,

36:52.560 --> 36:54.320
which is federal entity.

36:54.320 --> 36:58.280
So the chain of custody of that, that's certificate.

36:58.280 --> 37:01.680
And the original one written and every version of it

37:01.680 --> 37:03.520
should be obtained by defense counsel.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.160
You've got more time, right?

37:07.160 --> 37:08.320
If we're gonna go over to Rumble,

37:08.320 --> 37:09.160
and then I'll keep you there

37:09.160 --> 37:11.560
and we'll start talking a bit about some of the COVID stuff

37:11.560 --> 37:12.400
for a bit.

37:12.400 --> 37:13.840
You got a little bit more time?

37:13.840 --> 37:14.680
Absolutely.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.600
Okay, so, and that does it for Chauvin.

37:17.280 --> 37:18.880
These are the questions, this is the data,

37:18.880 --> 37:20.800
and there's something that doesn't make sense

37:20.800 --> 37:23.360
that needs to be made sense of

37:23.360 --> 37:25.840
if it means nothing more than cramming.

37:25.840 --> 37:28.320
What is it, a square peg into a circle hole,

37:28.320 --> 37:30.640
or is it a circle peg into a square hole?

37:30.640 --> 37:33.560
There's information that requires clarification

37:33.560 --> 37:35.240
because the underlying cause of death code

37:35.240 --> 37:37.320
coming back from the CDC does not match

37:37.320 --> 37:39.600
the conviction information

37:39.600 --> 37:44.600
and the other data on the CDC's info space place.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.360
That was a one egg of a way to sing database.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.120
Okay, what we're gonna do now, everybody,

37:51.120 --> 37:51.960
just give us two seconds,

37:51.960 --> 37:53.760
I'm gonna give everyone the link.

37:53.760 --> 37:54.840
So, you're coming over to Rumble

37:54.840 --> 37:57.840
because also, I'm not scared of YouTube,

37:57.840 --> 37:59.000
but they might not like some of the stuff

37:59.000 --> 37:59.880
that you're gonna tell us,

37:59.880 --> 38:02.840
which I might snip and clip and stick out there anyhow.

38:02.840 --> 38:05.720
Get on over to Rumble, and we're gonna end on YouTube,

38:06.720 --> 38:08.840
or go to vivabarnslaw.locals.com

38:08.840 --> 38:13.400
for those of you who might not be able to access Rumble

38:13.400 --> 38:14.680
if you happen to be in France,

38:14.680 --> 38:16.280
and I saw that chat from earlier on,

38:16.280 --> 38:17.960
go to vivabarnslaw.locals.com,

38:17.960 --> 38:19.040
we're streaming there as well now.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.320
So, one thing's for certain, we're ending on YouTube.

38:21.320 --> 38:26.520
So, Rumble or Locals see there in five, four, three, two, one.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.400
All right, John, let's get into some,

38:28.400 --> 38:30.640
let's get into, my questions,

38:30.640 --> 38:32.000
we're going back to the first question

38:32.000 --> 38:36.320
of the apportioning or the deaths that occurred

38:36.320 --> 38:38.200
for the five years prior to COVID

38:38.200 --> 38:40.960
compared to the three and a half going on four years after.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.360
You said that there were an average of however many,

38:43.400 --> 38:47.800
but 8,000 excess deaths in the peak of the curve

38:47.800 --> 38:50.480
that we all had to kill ourselves to flatten,

38:50.480 --> 38:52.400
no pun intended.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.480
Flush that out a little more

38:53.480 --> 38:57.360
because I presume now the excess deaths in 23 and 22

38:57.360 --> 38:59.800
far exceed the excess deaths that occurred

38:59.800 --> 39:02.760
at the height of the pandemic, and even in 2021.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
No.

39:05.000 --> 39:05.840
Damn.

39:05.840 --> 39:09.240
No, well, first of all, it depends on where you are.

39:09.240 --> 39:11.760
Where people get it wrong,

39:11.760 --> 39:13.440
a lot of big names get it wrong

39:13.440 --> 39:16.640
is that they think data has integrity and veracity

39:16.640 --> 39:18.040
and it doesn't.

39:18.040 --> 39:20.240
You have to go state by state

39:20.240 --> 39:22.040
and you have to learn the custom and practice

39:22.040 --> 39:24.480
of the medical examiners and doctors

39:24.480 --> 39:27.200
who are filling out that certificates in those states.

39:27.200 --> 39:30.360
One state might say something to do with cancer

39:30.360 --> 39:34.720
and bone and marrow and another state might be like,

39:34.720 --> 39:36.720
yeah, it's like bone cancer or whatever.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.000
It comes out completely different

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
when it gets translated into ICD 10 codes.

39:40.040 --> 39:45.040
In Michigan, the C4-1 bone and particular cartilage cancers

39:45.600 --> 39:49.640
are very high and in Massachusetts, C7-9-5,

39:49.640 --> 39:51.360
bone and bone marrow cancers are high.

39:51.360 --> 39:53.960
So I just wanted to say there that

39:53.960 --> 39:55.920
there are differences by state.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.320
So what happened by state?

39:58.640 --> 40:01.480
Really, I got to shorten this up.

40:01.480 --> 40:04.320
More than 4,000 people died in Massachusetts,

40:04.320 --> 40:07.160
I believe from the vaccine and I can show that with data

40:07.160 --> 40:09.360
and I can back it up with individual cases,

40:10.360 --> 40:14.040
especially Breonna was 30 years old,

40:14.040 --> 40:16.160
high school English teacher,

40:16.160 --> 40:19.920
got the Moderna, reacted in hours, terrible headache,

40:19.920 --> 40:21.800
went to the ER headache was so bad.

40:23.200 --> 40:26.120
She went back to the ER again, terrible headache,

40:26.120 --> 40:27.400
take Tylen, I'll go home.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.880
She didn't recognize her sister,

40:29.880 --> 40:30.920
the family brought her in,

40:30.920 --> 40:32.800
they cut a hole in her head to relieve the pressure,

40:32.800 --> 40:36.080
didn't work because clots were all through her head.

40:36.080 --> 40:38.120
She had a seizure, paralyzed in half her body,

40:38.120 --> 40:39.600
she was brain dead in a couple of days,

40:39.600 --> 40:41.280
they took her off life support in two weeks

40:41.280 --> 40:43.240
and they wrote on her death certificate.

40:43.240 --> 40:44.080
COVID.

40:44.080 --> 40:44.920
COVID.

40:46.120 --> 40:48.600
And six doctors from Harvard Medical College

40:48.600 --> 40:50.520
and Beth Israel Beaconist Medical Center

40:50.520 --> 40:52.600
wrote a report about her entitled,

40:52.600 --> 40:56.080
Fatal Post-COVID mRNA Vaccine Associated Cerebral Ischemia,

40:56.080 --> 40:57.200
which means.

40:57.200 --> 41:00.320
Bleeding on the, well, is it bleeding, right?

41:00.320 --> 41:02.800
No, no, no, it's the other, that's hemorrhagic.

41:02.800 --> 41:03.640
Okay.

41:04.640 --> 41:06.720
What that means, real short, sorry,

41:06.720 --> 41:09.200
the vaccine killed her by stroke.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.760
That's what that means.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.040
They're telling you in the title,

41:12.040 --> 41:15.240
the vaccine killed her by stroke.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.000
Fatal dead, right?

41:17.000 --> 41:19.640
Post-COVID mRNA vaccine,

41:19.640 --> 41:21.800
so after the COVID mRNA vaccine,

41:21.800 --> 41:23.280
Associated Cerebral Ischemia,

41:23.280 --> 41:25.000
which is stroked by clots

41:25.000 --> 41:29.080
and blocking downstream oxygenation of cells,

41:29.080 --> 41:30.840
so your brain cells die.

41:31.320 --> 41:32.720
Chats, correct me, clotting.

41:32.720 --> 41:36.120
So it was a 50-50 and I got it wrong.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.800
And if I may ask the obvious question,

41:37.800 --> 41:40.800
what does her death certificate say to this day?

41:40.800 --> 41:44.040
It still says COVID as the last in part one,

41:44.040 --> 41:45.880
which I was talking about moments ago

41:45.880 --> 41:47.040
with regard to George Floyd.

41:47.040 --> 41:50.200
So the last thing listed is COVID-19.

41:50.200 --> 41:52.560
Now, even in the six-page medical report,

41:52.560 --> 41:56.520
it says she was asymptomatic for COVID three months earlier,

41:56.520 --> 41:58.040
which was really four and a half months

41:58.040 --> 42:01.080
because I've talked to an extended family member.

42:01.080 --> 42:03.800
But regardless of three or four and a half months,

42:03.800 --> 42:06.760
she reacted to the vaccine in hours

42:06.760 --> 42:09.320
and she was brain dead in two days.

42:09.320 --> 42:13.440
Whereas she had COVID three to four and a half months earlier

42:13.440 --> 42:16.360
without symptoms, just a positive test,

42:16.360 --> 42:18.960
and they told the world on her death certificate

42:18.960 --> 42:20.280
that COVID caused her death.

42:21.640 --> 42:26.080
That's one of, so what I do is I take the data

42:26.120 --> 42:28.200
that shows that people are dying from strokes

42:28.200 --> 42:30.320
or cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism,

42:30.320 --> 42:33.080
acute post-traumatic anemia, thrombocytophenia,

42:33.080 --> 42:34.520
those graphs are through the roof,

42:34.520 --> 42:36.560
like you've never seen anywhere else.

42:36.560 --> 42:39.120
And what I do is I trace those down to people.

42:39.120 --> 42:42.000
I correlate them to VAERS records with the same age,

42:42.000 --> 42:45.640
the same death date, the same gender,

42:45.640 --> 42:47.440
and same other symptoms.

42:47.440 --> 42:49.360
And I know I have the right person

42:49.360 --> 42:51.920
and then I can ascertain the vaccination date

42:51.920 --> 42:53.760
from the VAERS record.

42:53.920 --> 42:56.960
In all of this data, there's, like I said,

42:56.960 --> 42:58.600
there's nothing else like this in the world

42:58.600 --> 42:59.680
with absolute proof.

43:00.640 --> 43:02.360
But now you said, just to show

43:02.360 --> 43:03.640
that I'm not an idiot, everybody,

43:03.640 --> 43:05.360
that much of an idiot, hold on.

43:05.360 --> 43:08.520
In Canada, more people than expected

43:08.520 --> 43:10.240
are dying in Canada for 2023,

43:10.240 --> 43:12.080
for reasons that are not yet clear.

43:12.080 --> 43:15.800
So the excess mortality in Canada is definitively out.

43:15.800 --> 43:18.320
But I'm asking this, you would be able to tell

43:18.320 --> 43:20.280
if there's not excess mortality overall

43:20.280 --> 43:21.640
because now all of the, and I'm not saying this

43:21.720 --> 43:23.240
to be glibber or crass,

43:23.240 --> 43:25.520
all of the old fragile people have pretty much,

43:25.520 --> 43:28.000
you know, got killed in the first wave of this.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.760
So there might not be excess deaths as a raw number,

43:30.760 --> 43:32.200
but there would certainly be excess deaths

43:32.200 --> 43:33.760
within certain age brackets.

43:33.760 --> 43:34.600
You got it.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.440
You got the whole Kitten kaboodle there.

43:36.440 --> 43:38.040
That's what says it all.

43:38.040 --> 43:39.720
So the deaths I cited it.

43:39.720 --> 43:42.760
So Massachusetts is very different from the world.

43:42.760 --> 43:45.400
Okay, New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts.

43:47.240 --> 43:49.560
600 pharma companies in Massachusetts

43:49.560 --> 43:52.360
with 47 billion in venture capital financing.

43:52.360 --> 43:54.760
There are 10 companies in massive pharma companies

43:54.760 --> 43:57.880
in Massachusetts with over a billion in revenue.

43:57.880 --> 44:00.440
50 companies with over 100 million in revenue.

44:00.440 --> 44:03.840
Moderna's headquarters, I drive by on my way to Costco

44:03.840 --> 44:05.680
to go by groceries.

44:05.680 --> 44:08.640
Pfizer's divisional headquarters for their mRNA vaccine

44:08.640 --> 44:10.440
is in Andover, Massachusetts.

44:10.440 --> 44:14.680
So you've got R&D, marketing and manufacturing

44:14.680 --> 44:16.640
in Massachusetts for these vaccines.

44:16.640 --> 44:18.880
And in New York City, you've got Wall Street,

44:18.880 --> 44:20.920
where the executives for pharma live,

44:20.920 --> 44:23.520
and you've got New Jersey as a suburb,

44:23.520 --> 44:25.360
those three ran away from the world

44:25.360 --> 44:27.560
and purported COVID deaths per population

44:27.560 --> 44:30.640
in the first months of COVID, the first year.

44:30.640 --> 44:32.720
Belgium was a distant fourth.

44:32.720 --> 44:34.160
I'm talking in the world.

44:34.160 --> 44:36.280
Belgium was a distant fourth.

44:36.280 --> 44:38.480
Why did Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey,

44:38.480 --> 44:41.600
half a world away from China have the most COVID deaths

44:41.600 --> 44:43.400
because it was mostly fraud.

44:43.400 --> 44:46.040
90% of the COVID deaths in mass were fraud.

44:46.040 --> 44:47.280
They weren't COVID.

44:47.280 --> 44:50.560
And so, but there was excess deaths.

44:50.560 --> 44:52.800
It was caused by a lot of protocol deaths,

44:52.800 --> 44:55.160
recommendations from the CDC.

44:55.160 --> 44:57.720
And people say, well, why would doctors kill people knowingly?

44:57.720 --> 44:58.720
Well, they're not knowingly.

44:58.720 --> 45:01.760
They're just following the recommendations of the CDC.

45:01.760 --> 45:05.120
I mean, I presume you were able to also confirm the data

45:05.120 --> 45:07.200
that the ventilators killed more people

45:07.200 --> 45:09.600
than they potentially ever saved.

45:09.600 --> 45:13.360
Oh, well, absolutely.

45:13.360 --> 45:16.840
In addition to the book that's right there,

45:16.840 --> 45:19.360
the real CDC, all right.

45:19.360 --> 45:23.440
And I'm not trying to copy the real Anthony Fauci.

45:23.440 --> 45:25.960
I wrote under the name Kocan de Chiena,

45:25.960 --> 45:28.040
which is Naughty Dog in French,

45:28.040 --> 45:30.880
and the initials of which just happened to be CDC.

45:30.880 --> 45:33.320
You said, Kocan de Chien?

45:34.320 --> 45:35.160
Yeah.

45:35.160 --> 45:37.760
Okay, Kocan is a, okay, find out.

45:37.760 --> 45:39.960
I'm sorry, I didn't understand your accent there, sir.

45:39.960 --> 45:40.800
Okay.

45:40.800 --> 45:42.640
Yeah, well, I don't see the CDC.

45:43.640 --> 45:44.600
All right, sorry, go on.

45:44.640 --> 45:48.080
Now, so I just happened to write under that name,

45:48.080 --> 45:50.040
because I like El Gato Malo, the bad cat,

45:50.040 --> 45:52.800
and I'm French, so I made it, and I like dogs,

45:52.800 --> 45:54.400
so I made it the bad dog, right?

45:54.400 --> 45:58.160
So the book, I was like, well, I'm the real CDC,

45:58.160 --> 46:00.200
with a little D for Duh.

46:00.200 --> 46:04.120
Anyway, the second document I have coming out,

46:04.120 --> 46:06.240
around the same time, hopefully before Christmas,

46:06.240 --> 46:08.320
is called the CDC Memorandum.

46:08.320 --> 46:10.600
It's 100 pages of factual allegations

46:10.680 --> 46:13.240
being enumerated in a legal type,

46:13.240 --> 46:17.480
memorandum double-space, double-line-space.

46:18.800 --> 46:22.560
Along with legal analysis of uttering,

46:22.560 --> 46:24.800
involuntary manslaughter, depraved heart murder,

46:24.800 --> 46:28.560
and felony murder, and it has a lot of ventilator deaths.

46:28.560 --> 46:30.920
I have six files right now.

46:30.920 --> 46:35.560
Each file is several thousand pages of medical records

46:35.560 --> 46:37.840
for people who were killed in hospitals.

46:37.880 --> 46:42.880
There's, Danielle was 95% oxygen when she went in.

46:43.920 --> 46:46.760
They hit her with remdesivir immediately.

46:46.760 --> 46:51.200
The EU away from desivir was like April, May of 2020,

46:51.200 --> 46:52.880
and then October 22nd.

46:52.880 --> 46:56.120
That still didn't kick in the acute renal failure deaths.

46:56.120 --> 46:58.280
They started after November 2nd.

46:58.280 --> 47:01.400
That's the monetary, CMS.gov date,

47:01.400 --> 47:04.080
where they get 20% extra.

47:04.080 --> 47:06.800
Everything was behavior modification

47:06.800 --> 47:08.800
through financial incentives.

47:08.800 --> 47:10.120
That's what the CARES Act was,

47:10.120 --> 47:13.000
was a behavior modification of the entire health industry

47:13.000 --> 47:15.880
to steer doctors and hospitals toward using

47:15.880 --> 47:18.760
whatever medication they wanted them to use.

47:18.760 --> 47:20.200
So all the money that flowed,

47:20.200 --> 47:21.720
and they didn't care how much money flowed,

47:21.720 --> 47:23.880
it was trillions to kill people.

47:23.880 --> 47:26.680
They just did what they were told, the doctors do.

47:27.520 --> 47:30.080
If you could briefly flesh that out.

47:30.080 --> 47:31.480
We've heard discussion about it.

47:31.480 --> 47:33.640
I've always seen financial incentives

47:33.640 --> 47:36.200
to declare certain deaths COVID deaths.

47:36.200 --> 47:38.280
Financial incentives to administer certain types

47:38.280 --> 47:41.240
of treatment, remdesivir ventilators.

47:41.240 --> 47:42.080
You got it.

47:42.080 --> 47:42.920
I mean, Walter Williams,

47:42.920 --> 47:44.800
if you want more of something, subsidize it.

47:44.800 --> 47:46.920
They subsidize something and they knew the behavior

47:46.920 --> 47:49.120
that would flow from their written words.

47:49.120 --> 47:50.920
And the behavior is the doctors

47:50.920 --> 47:53.720
and the hospital administrator is going to tell the doctors.

47:53.720 --> 47:56.640
And I know a doctor moved out of state

47:56.640 --> 47:58.360
because he didn't want to kill people.

47:58.360 --> 47:59.760
And he told me what they were doing.

47:59.760 --> 48:03.080
They had a 95% oxygen guy come in.

48:03.080 --> 48:04.200
They put him on a ventilator

48:04.200 --> 48:06.360
because the administrators told the doctors,

48:06.360 --> 48:09.200
if you don't do that, we're all going to die.

48:09.200 --> 48:12.560
Because the ventilator contains the aerosols to the patient

48:12.560 --> 48:14.080
and the CPAP doesn't.

48:14.080 --> 48:16.000
So if you don't put them on the ventilator,

48:16.000 --> 48:17.240
then the nurses are going to die,

48:17.240 --> 48:18.720
the doctors are going to die.

48:18.720 --> 48:21.200
So the doctors put them on a ventilator

48:21.200 --> 48:24.240
to save the doctors and nurses and they killed people.

48:24.240 --> 48:25.560
I mean, basically, I mean,

48:25.560 --> 48:27.640
other than jamming something down his lungs,

48:27.640 --> 48:28.560
put a bag over his head.

48:28.560 --> 48:29.840
I mean, make him make him,

48:29.840 --> 48:31.440
I know that they oxygenated

48:31.440 --> 48:32.680
and it's not like inhaling CO2,

48:32.680 --> 48:34.960
but this was, and I forget who the guest was,

48:34.960 --> 48:37.480
that basically confirmed in the early days,

48:37.480 --> 48:40.360
they were doing this as a matter of not helping the patient,

48:40.360 --> 48:43.000
but protecting the staff even out of their irrational fear

48:43.000 --> 48:45.640
of inhaling the same air in the same room.

48:45.640 --> 48:49.400
And they got incentives for the ventilators, Remdesivir.

48:49.400 --> 48:53.320
When did it become clear that Remdesivir was correlated with,

48:53.320 --> 48:55.280
I won't say cause because I'm not a doctor,

48:55.280 --> 48:58.040
correlated with renal failure, organ failure?

48:59.360 --> 49:02.360
I don't know about the general public, but in the data,

49:02.360 --> 49:04.280
I have for both Massachusetts and Minnesota.

49:04.280 --> 49:06.040
The Minnesota is actually,

49:06.040 --> 49:08.560
both of them are very stark

49:08.560 --> 49:10.400
if you understand how to read waveforms.

49:10.400 --> 49:14.240
Now, I'll just say that COVID had a very high wave

49:14.240 --> 49:15.320
in Massachusetts.

49:15.320 --> 49:17.240
Remember, I said Massachusetts is very different,

49:17.240 --> 49:18.080
the first wave,

49:18.080 --> 49:19.800
we scared the world into believing

49:19.800 --> 49:22.000
that this was far worse than it was.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.120
So you have this high wave of COVID

49:25.120 --> 49:26.560
and then you have another smaller wave

49:26.560 --> 49:29.040
in the winter of COVID, there's no correlation.

49:29.040 --> 49:33.040
And in Minnesota, let's say there's a smaller wave of COVID,

49:33.040 --> 49:36.120
renal failure did not go up with COVID in 2020.

49:36.120 --> 49:37.640
And then in the end of the year,

49:37.640 --> 49:41.600
it still did not go up with COVID at the end of 2020.

49:41.600 --> 49:46.600
And in 2021, so I told you the money kicked in November 2nd,

49:47.280 --> 49:49.200
around two weeks after that time,

49:49.200 --> 49:53.360
so end of November, December, all of a sudden,

49:53.360 --> 49:55.440
acute renal failure and COVID deaths

49:55.440 --> 49:58.120
start paralleling each other perfectly, the curves,

49:58.120 --> 50:01.120
they follow each other, like they're swimming together,

50:01.120 --> 50:02.320
it's perfect.

50:02.320 --> 50:06.880
And the renal failure deaths just take off, like a rocket,

50:06.880 --> 50:11.320
2000 extra acute renal failure involved deaths

50:11.320 --> 50:14.760
in Massachusetts alone, in 21 and 22.

50:14.760 --> 50:18.480
That's just Massachusetts, 600 in Minnesota.

50:18.480 --> 50:19.320
Sorry.

50:19.320 --> 50:23.720
No, it just makes sense of this for the adults like myself.

50:23.720 --> 50:25.200
The reason why this is relevant is

50:25.200 --> 50:26.640
because you didn't see renal failure

50:26.640 --> 50:27.840
with the initial wave of COVID,

50:27.840 --> 50:28.720
but now you're seeing it

50:28.720 --> 50:31.720
with a subsequent waves of COVID,

50:31.720 --> 50:34.280
coupled with whatever the order was

50:34.280 --> 50:38.480
to the practical order to treat COVID with remdesiviors.

50:38.480 --> 50:43.400
Well, the order to treat them was there earlier.

50:43.400 --> 50:45.200
But the financial is that they're kicked in.

50:45.200 --> 50:48.280
When the money kicked in, okay, it's the money.

50:48.280 --> 50:51.080
When the money kicked in, the behavior changed.

50:53.760 --> 50:55.040
That's just the way it is.

50:55.040 --> 50:58.080
What was it again, the date at which the money kicked in

50:58.080 --> 50:59.120
and what was the name of that order?

50:59.120 --> 51:00.400
It had three letters to it?

51:00.400 --> 51:03.200
Oh, if you go to CMS.gov, you can find it.

51:03.200 --> 51:04.400
It's on November 2nd.

51:04.400 --> 51:07.120
So if you do, again, links in my book,

51:07.120 --> 51:11.280
I can't memorize, I get hundreds of references.

51:11.280 --> 51:13.400
But yeah, if you go to CMS.gov

51:14.680 --> 51:19.680
and you look for COVID protocols, COVID treatments, drugs,

51:20.080 --> 51:23.280
you'll find barisit nib, which is another one

51:23.280 --> 51:26.760
that they think killed people and remdesivirring.

51:26.760 --> 51:30.720
And David, I don't necessarily believe

51:30.720 --> 51:34.360
that remdesivir alone took out people's kidneys.

51:34.360 --> 51:36.040
I believe it's a combination.

51:36.040 --> 51:39.320
Every single one I've found, vancomycin is there.

51:39.320 --> 51:41.480
And a doctor told me, no, it can't be vancomycin.

51:41.480 --> 51:44.240
It's like vancomycin is a kidney killer.

51:44.240 --> 51:45.760
Absolutely is.

51:45.760 --> 51:48.640
And by vancomycin, go ahead.

51:48.640 --> 51:49.480
Sorry.

51:49.480 --> 51:51.560
So just like I thought I was sufficiently black-pilled,

51:51.600 --> 51:54.280
John, thank you for making me even more black-pilled.

51:54.280 --> 51:57.120
I think this is at CMS issued an interim final rule

51:57.120 --> 51:58.400
with a comment period that established

51:58.400 --> 52:01.000
the new COVID-19 treatment, add-on payment,

52:01.000 --> 52:04.040
under the Medicare inpatient perspective payment system.

52:04.040 --> 52:05.080
These things were foreign to me.

52:05.080 --> 52:08.040
The NCTAP designed to mitigate

52:08.040 --> 52:10.520
the potential financial disincentives for hospitals

52:10.520 --> 52:12.360
to provide new COVID-19 treatments

52:12.360 --> 52:15.120
was effective from November 2nd, 2020

52:15.120 --> 52:17.920
until September 23rd, is that it?

52:17.920 --> 52:20.400
The NACT, oh, so maybe that's not exactly

52:20.400 --> 52:22.600
what I thought it was going to confirm what you said there.

52:22.600 --> 52:23.480
Yeah, if you go down there,

52:23.480 --> 52:26.400
allumiant is barisit nib.

52:26.400 --> 52:28.360
And veclary, if you go down to the bottom,

52:28.360 --> 52:29.800
look for veclary.

52:29.800 --> 52:30.600
Yeah, here we go.

52:30.600 --> 52:32.200
See what it says next to veclary.

52:33.840 --> 52:34.680
Remdesivir.

52:36.480 --> 52:39.600
The second word in that paragraph, Remdesivir.

52:39.600 --> 52:40.920
And that's January 21.

52:41.920 --> 52:44.040
Well, that's, that was the,

52:44.040 --> 52:47.400
these are just things that they're re-approving

52:47.400 --> 52:49.280
and redoing those dates.

52:49.280 --> 52:51.360
But the key date there you saw at the beginning

52:51.360 --> 52:52.360
is November 2nd.

52:55.320 --> 52:57.520
Holy crap apples, okay.

52:57.520 --> 52:59.080
Now it gets a lot worse than that.

52:59.080 --> 53:00.440
You want to keep going?

53:00.440 --> 53:05.520
You have to laugh or cry at those are the two options.

53:05.520 --> 53:10.520
Well, I mean, in 2020, excuse me,

53:11.200 --> 53:14.000
in 2022 when I got the data,

53:14.000 --> 53:17.200
the first thing I did was I wrote a bunch of code

53:17.200 --> 53:18.040
in spreadsheets.

53:18.040 --> 53:21.240
I wish I could write SQL SQL, but I can't.

53:21.240 --> 53:23.240
So I did it in spreadsheets.

53:23.240 --> 53:28.240
And I just, I told the 2020 and 2021 columns

53:28.880 --> 53:32.040
to turn yellow, whichever one was greater.

53:32.040 --> 53:34.800
And when I put in all the codes

53:34.800 --> 53:37.080
and I did analyses on all the years,

53:38.000 --> 53:42.720
the greater access of respiratory codes was in 2020.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.600
So pneumonia, like people were dying

53:45.600 --> 53:49.840
from pneumonia, ARDS, COPD more than normal in 2020.

53:50.680 --> 53:53.720
Then all of a sudden they start vaccinating in 2021

53:53.720 --> 53:56.480
and all the I codes which are circulatory

53:56.480 --> 53:57.840
and decodes which are blood.

53:57.840 --> 54:01.320
So anything to do with a blood or blood transport system,

54:01.320 --> 54:04.440
they went through the roof, they blew away the pneumonia,

54:04.440 --> 54:07.400
cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmia,

54:07.400 --> 54:09.080
like young people dying in their sleep

54:09.080 --> 54:12.520
or dying on the sports field, pulmonary embolism,

54:12.520 --> 54:16.880
clots and lungs, tons of those, post hemorrhagic anemia.

54:16.880 --> 54:18.760
That means sudden blood loss anemia.

54:18.760 --> 54:20.600
That means, and I looked through them,

54:20.600 --> 54:23.680
more than 89% were non-traumatic.

54:23.680 --> 54:27.280
Which means you randomly start having internal bleeding.

54:27.280 --> 54:29.960
Yep, yep, you weren't hit by something

54:29.960 --> 54:32.000
that the surgeon didn't make an oopsie

54:32.000 --> 54:33.760
in the operating room.

54:33.760 --> 54:35.160
Oh no, John, you're wrong.

54:35.160 --> 54:36.120
They were magically hit.

54:36.120 --> 54:38.440
They were suddenly hit by climate change.

54:38.440 --> 54:39.520
It's a sports drink.

54:39.520 --> 54:41.640
So what's the other one there?

54:41.640 --> 54:43.000
Oh my goodness.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.680
So when people say, I'm noticing from my own,

54:47.680 --> 54:49.600
what's the word, just observation,

54:49.600 --> 54:53.280
a lot more people of middle age dropping dead in their sleep.

54:53.280 --> 54:54.880
And then it was like, well, you have no data.

54:54.880 --> 54:58.080
Do you have data to support that that is a cause of death

54:58.080 --> 54:59.240
has increased?

54:59.240 --> 55:01.800
Whether or not we want to say it's the long COVID,

55:01.800 --> 55:05.320
that has increased and we're not like tricking ourselves?

55:05.320 --> 55:09.960
I do, the hard part is showing it to people.

55:10.440 --> 55:13.040
You can show it to scientists, right?

55:13.040 --> 55:17.320
Who aren't people, but regular people.

55:17.320 --> 55:19.920
You show them a graph and they're like,

55:19.920 --> 55:22.160
I don't remember school, you know?

55:22.160 --> 55:23.720
It's tough.

55:23.720 --> 55:25.480
You really nailed it at the beginning, though,

55:25.480 --> 55:27.080
when you said bunch of old people.

55:27.080 --> 55:30.040
So it creates what's called a Simpsons paradox.

55:30.040 --> 55:32.520
So if you have two things happening,

55:32.520 --> 55:34.640
one is low and one is high,

55:34.640 --> 55:37.440
and you combine them and say, oh, look at what I have.

55:37.440 --> 55:38.920
Well, what you have is zero.

55:38.960 --> 55:42.480
Negative one and positive one are zero.

55:42.480 --> 55:44.600
But if you saw them independently, you'd say,

55:44.600 --> 55:47.040
well, why are those low and why are those high?

55:47.040 --> 55:50.800
So what happened in 2020 in nine weeks in Massachusetts

55:50.800 --> 55:53.160
created Simpsons paradoxes that will last three,

55:53.160 --> 55:54.280
four, five years.

55:54.280 --> 55:56.720
And that means all the old people died.

55:56.720 --> 55:57.920
Who would die?

55:57.920 --> 55:58.920
They died early.

55:58.920 --> 56:01.080
Did they die six months early, a year early?

56:01.080 --> 56:03.440
I mean, it peanut butters over time.

56:03.440 --> 56:07.280
But what that did was when it went back to normal,

56:07.280 --> 56:08.360
it shouldn't have been normal.

56:08.360 --> 56:10.560
It should have been a deficit of excess deaths.

56:10.560 --> 56:12.200
It should have been a deficit, but it wasn't

56:12.200 --> 56:15.800
because the younger people were dying from the vaccine

56:15.800 --> 56:17.680
and they were filling in that deficit

56:17.680 --> 56:19.480
that the old people left.

56:19.480 --> 56:20.320
Does that make sense?

56:20.320 --> 56:23.160
Yeah, well, for sure, the initial waves go through,

56:23.160 --> 56:24.920
they take up the week in the elderly.

56:24.920 --> 56:26.560
And so you have an increase there,

56:26.560 --> 56:29.960
the young who are not yet succumbing to whatever it is.

56:29.960 --> 56:33.040
And then those 10th, let's just take Massachusetts.

56:33.040 --> 56:34.960
Those 8,000 old people who died in 2020

56:34.960 --> 56:36.960
are not there in 2022 to die.

56:36.960 --> 56:38.080
But the number remains the same

56:38.080 --> 56:40.880
because other people have filled their shoes.

56:40.880 --> 56:42.480
And even in the young people,

56:42.480 --> 56:46.640
let's look at the young people who died in the year of COVID.

56:46.640 --> 56:51.640
You've got Down syndrome, you've got cerebral palsy,

56:52.800 --> 56:54.800
all kinds of genetic disorders

56:54.800 --> 56:56.760
where people were somewhat unhealthy

56:56.760 --> 56:58.400
through their younger years

56:58.400 --> 57:01.080
and they didn't make it past seven or 10 or 12.

57:02.200 --> 57:05.000
Those are the kids who died with COVID.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.920
Like what did they really die from?

57:06.920 --> 57:09.120
Not sure, but they died with COVID.

57:09.120 --> 57:13.280
Those week, and I hate to say it like that, right,

57:15.080 --> 57:18.560
susceptible to various types of death,

57:18.560 --> 57:22.720
they were gone in 21 and all of a sudden you've got athletes

57:23.680 --> 57:28.120
dying on basketball courts and cross country running.

57:28.120 --> 57:31.240
And that did not happen in 2020 from COVID.

57:31.240 --> 57:33.000
None of those people died from COVID.

57:33.000 --> 57:37.080
Let me, I'll ask you these steel men rebuttal.

57:37.080 --> 57:39.280
People are gonna say, there was the data that said,

57:39.280 --> 57:42.160
X amount more athletes died or collapsed this year

57:42.160 --> 57:43.640
than in previous years.

57:43.640 --> 57:45.880
The rebuttal to that is, well, there was one case

57:45.880 --> 57:48.360
of they found one example who wasn't an athlete

57:48.360 --> 57:50.360
and then the flip side argument also they say,

57:50.360 --> 57:52.640
well, we're now include, there are more athletes now

57:52.640 --> 57:55.680
and we're including more people in the athlete category

57:55.680 --> 57:57.920
than we did back in 2016, for example.

57:57.920 --> 57:59.720
So that skews the numbers.

57:59.760 --> 58:03.320
Do you have a concrete way of rebutting that rebuttal?

58:03.320 --> 58:04.680
Absolutely.

58:04.680 --> 58:07.000
It's crazy to look at data in those cases.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.640
The cases are so few, you look and see in their heart,

58:10.640 --> 58:14.640
their heart's being attacked by ASNafils or lymphocytes.

58:14.640 --> 58:16.800
So certain types of white blood cells

58:16.800 --> 58:21.800
that do not respond necessarily to COVID,

58:21.800 --> 58:24.120
they do respond to the vaccine.

58:24.120 --> 58:28.320
So the vaccine creates a system where when the cells

58:28.320 --> 58:32.480
are transfected by the vaccine, by the lipid nanoparticles,

58:32.480 --> 58:34.760
the body responds with ASNafils,

58:34.760 --> 58:39.000
a certain type of white cell and it attacks the heart muscle

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
or it attacks the endothelium in your brain.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.400
So the endothelium, the inside lining

58:43.400 --> 58:46.040
of all your blood vessels is called endothelium, right?

58:46.040 --> 58:48.200
They're endothelial cells.

58:48.200 --> 58:52.160
They are the first that are transfected by the vaccine.

58:52.160 --> 58:53.760
It doesn't stay in your arm.

58:53.760 --> 58:57.200
We know that, we were told it stays in your arm, it doesn't.

58:57.200 --> 58:58.520
It goes around your body.

58:58.520 --> 59:00.760
If you hit a vein with that injection,

59:00.760 --> 59:03.960
if you're the one in 50, one in 200, pick a number.

59:03.960 --> 59:06.120
I mean, there's no number that's good for me.

59:06.120 --> 59:08.560
I'm not joining that death lottery,

59:08.560 --> 59:11.320
but if you do take a hit in your vein,

59:11.320 --> 59:14.280
it's going somewhere and if it goes to your heart,

59:14.280 --> 59:15.320
it takes out your heart.

59:15.320 --> 59:17.680
If it goes to your brain, it takes out your brain.

59:17.680 --> 59:19.120
It goes into the cells.

59:19.120 --> 59:22.160
The cells say, ah, this isn't human, kill me.

59:22.160 --> 59:24.600
So T cells come and they attack

59:24.600 --> 59:27.040
and they eat away a hole in your endothelium.

59:27.040 --> 59:30.080
So your poke and holes in the capillaries in your vein,

59:30.080 --> 59:33.440
your body responds by clotting, everything's messed up.

59:33.440 --> 59:35.240
These are not vaccines.

59:35.240 --> 59:37.040
People got to get it through their heads.

59:37.040 --> 59:39.240
These are, they changed the definition of vaccine.

59:39.240 --> 59:41.600
You know that in order to call them vaccines.

59:41.600 --> 59:43.960
These are gene drug therapies never before used

59:43.960 --> 59:45.840
in humans on mass.

59:45.840 --> 59:47.600
I'm going to see if I can pull up the article

59:47.600 --> 59:49.280
that said that the CDC guidance

59:49.280 --> 59:51.640
when administering the vaccine was not to aspirate

59:51.640 --> 59:53.120
because that would make that,

59:53.120 --> 59:55.320
that would make a needle reluctant people

59:55.320 --> 59:56.680
even more reluctant to get the jab.

59:56.680 --> 59:58.200
So you don't aspirate.

59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.400
You don't even know that you haven't tapped into a vein.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.920
And then you can inject the jab directly into a vein

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.160
which you're not supposed to do

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.160
under any circumstances from what I understand.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.000
Right.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.400
So it's called the pink book by the CDC.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.840
It was put out by two nurses.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.960
Their names are on the web.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.960
I have them as references.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.440
If not in my book, then it's in my lawsuit against the governor.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.760
And in that, the nurses state,

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.040
we don't want the patient to be uncomfortable.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.560
Needle wiggle might cause discomfort.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.960
So not only do not aspirate,

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.880
but inject as fast as you can.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.400
Like, are you kidding me?

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.600
So both of those things are terrible.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.080
And in the next paragraph,

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.920
they write in the paragraph after that,

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.640
they write, we don't have any scientific evidence for this.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.520
We just think it'll be more comfortable for the patient.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.040
That's how dumb this whole thing is.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.800
The whole world follows the CDC.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:53.960
The CDC had two nurses write this pink book

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.440
on how to inject with no scientific evidence of what's better.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.760
Mark Giridault out of France has done so much work

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.920
in studying a ball of BOLUS.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:08.600
That's, you inject to get a whole bunch of travels to somewhere.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:13.160
Now, why do you think aortic dissections are happening at the arch?

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.040
And why are they there?

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.560
Now, I'm an engineer, so I'm thinking,

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:19.800
the density of the lipid nanoparticles

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.520
is different than the rest of the fluid in the blood.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.840
When it goes around the arch,

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.040
there are Bernoulli equations for fluid dynamics

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.640
that will say where are those going to go

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.520
based on the relative density?

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.360
And if it's at the same spot,

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.720
if the aortic dissections are happening at the same spot,

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.320
you can say something different from blood

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.320
is going to that spot based on the relative density.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.680
And based on fluid dynamics,

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.640
you could say, yep, the lipid nanoparticles

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.680
are causing the body to eat a whole.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:51.680
And that's people's aortic arches are blown apart.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.880
I'm going to have to read this more thoroughly afterwards,

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.320
but I just came across this.

01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.240
Although the syringe aspiration

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.080
may increase the level of pain in the injection site,

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.320
it represents a simple technique

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.560
to decrease the risk of vaccine introduction

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:06.880
into the vascular system

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.400
and potentially decrease the risk of severe reactions

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.800
to mRNA and adenoviral vaccines.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.520
We are of the opinion that it cannot be disordered.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.080
I'm going to read this afterwards.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.520
That just struck me because I knew that.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.160
Or at least I thought I knew that.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.800
Just can't figure out where that where that article

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.280
in the NCBI is going.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.040
Holy crab apples.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.720
Do you have it?

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.960
Do you have any more doom pills?

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:34.240
Like is there a darker pill than the ones you've already given?

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.080
Oh man.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.280
You know, it all comes down to systems, right?

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:43.560
And the experts are looking at medical and biological systems

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.680
and they're missing a lot of the behavioral

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.760
and almost all of this is behavioral.

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:53.400
The CARES Act and other acts that were written,

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:58.160
like CARES Act, by the way, was 2019, excuse me, 2019.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.800
How did they know this was coming?

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.000
They just changed a few variables when they passed it in March.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.840
It was written in 2018.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.520
And everything to do with that

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.640
is behavior modifications for people to act differently,

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:12.240
which people, the doctors, nurses, and so forth.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.240
You've got medical board coercion.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:18.960
You have to understand the intersection of law, economics,

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.800
and psychology.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.480
And that's where we are.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:27.280
Because everything, David, when you meet people and I say,

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.760
well, you can't say that all these doctors

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.080
are killing people on purpose.

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.960
It's like, no, of course I'm not saying that,

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:35.280
but I can explain the behavioral system

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.600
that was put in place to make them do it.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.880
And they knew ahead of time what they were doing.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:42.400
I didn't start here, David.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.360
I started, like, I don't believe anybody.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.000
There's no way they're doing this.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.080
Oh, there's no way.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.840
The only way to mess with all cause death

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.000
is to actually kill people.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.360
There's no way they're killing people.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.200
I was wrong.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.800
Well, and John, I've been saying it for a while.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.840
I didn't start off on Nuremberg 2.0, but my goodness.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.640
I'm there now.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.280
If you have a few minutes, I'm just going to,

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.440
oh, there's some questions in our locals community.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.760
Yeah, absolutely.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.880
This is from mighty pisses.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:07.720
Thank you, John.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.040
I'm in Massachusetts, and there's still a majority

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.240
who are oblivious to the harms of the experimental injections.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.600
Thank you for pursuing and exposing the truth.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:18.480
Mighty pisses, mighty pay is peace in French.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:24.400
Does John follow or work with ethical skeptic on Twitter?

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.080
I've tried.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.280
He doesn't work with other people,

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.600
and he does a really good job.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.520
I do very similar stuff, but I'm working

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:32.920
with record-level source data.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.920
So I have a level of detail that nobody else can do.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:39.600
Not only can I show the data, and data is only persuasive.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.760
When you look down into the individual person

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.280
and you look through their obituary and you read about them,

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.320
and if you can get medical records,

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.480
that data is conclusive, not just persuasive.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:53.720
And so I appreciate ethical skeptic's work.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:57.880
We've had a couple of messages back and forth.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.480
One thing that kind of handcuffs him

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.440
is he'll look at renal failure.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.480
I think he was looking at, CDC puts out

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.920
something of renal failure.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:09.440
It combines N17 and N18 that's chronic in the queue.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.440
Well, the problem is the chronic went down

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.360
because a bunch of old people died,

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.120
and then they weren't available to die again,

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.920
and they died with chronic renal failure,

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.040
maybe stage one, two, three, or four.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.920
And so then there's a deficit.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.320
And when you combine the two,

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.640
there was a 20% increase in renal failure.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.440
Like, okay, let me look at a queue.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.600
You didn't have a problem before.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.120
All of a sudden you have a problem.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:34.120
Now, acute renal failure was up 100%, 100%.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.960
Over 100,000 people in the United States

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.680
accessed more than normal

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.960
died of acute renal failure in the last two years.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.160
Not including 2023.

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.240
And so there's even more.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.920
So they murdered 100,000 people with these drugs.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.600
It was a side effect of long COVID, John.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.560
You'd be crazy if you think otherwise.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.160
Entry required says, read my post comment

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.200
and have John Bodwen senior comment

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.360
on what you interpret the substance of my outrage

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:01.160
and disappointment with those that faltered and cave.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.040
I presume that has to do with the jab.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.280
I'll see if I can find that.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.240
As much as big pharma is to blame for this,

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.320
and they are, they are not the only ones

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:12.120
lying on death certificates we need to never,

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.680
they are not the ones lying on death certificates.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:15.920
That's from Pasha Moyer.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:20.920
And there were some, there were some chats in the rumble,

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.520
which says, I'm not your buddy, guys,

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.720
says I'm, oh, these I can actually bring up

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.560
so we can see this.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.400
I love that game.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.640
What's amazing is, I see I'm not your buddy guy

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.400
on Bongino's feeds.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:34.880
I see the same character, our same community

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.080
in various streams.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.200
I'm not your buddy, guys, says Viva, I'm late.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.840
Did you see Dan Bongino give you a shout out

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:40.680
on his show this morning?

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.280
No.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.600
Unless this is an old stream.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.640
In regards to George Floyd had bothered me

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:47.960
with the amount of censorship as I reported

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:50.320
the full body cam and YouTube removed.

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:51.320
Oh yeah, this is no question.

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:54.400
They needed to, I remember what I thought originally,

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.960
and then I watched the trial.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:56.960
Green thumb nursing says,

01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.400
Hey Viva, please have John Porter on,

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.440
he's launching a Canadian barter system.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.440
Barter it, has been doing barter pay for decades,

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:04.960
huge freedom advocate from Ontario,

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.040
helping the United country.

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:06.880
Very cool.

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.960
I'm sure you must have seen him, John as well.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.320
When I saw the Floyd video,

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.920
I said that looked like cardiac drug induced

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.480
or both, from that point on,

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.400
I was forever labeled a heretic.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.480
And then Ginger Ninja says,

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.400
just to fulfill your fear,

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.760
click bait title, fake news,

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.760
every fear hides a wish, and so on.

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:28.040
So, at least I just got on a personal level.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.360
What sort of backlash demonization have you gotten

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:33.160
as an individual human in the state of Massachusetts?

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.000
And what the hell are you still doing in that state?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:35.840
You should come down to Florida.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:36.880
It's nice here.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.720
But what sort of backlash have you taken as an individual?

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.600
Well, I mean, I started out,

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.600
the whole mask thing was ridiculous, right?

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.600
So I sued the governor over the mask mandate

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.520
in May, end of May or early June of 2020.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:54.480
He didn't like, they were afraid of my lawsuit.

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:57.080
So he changed the order for the entire state.

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.000
I'm deaf in one ear.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.480
I got a shot when I was four years old,

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.360
stripped the mice in a penicillin mixed together.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.640
It makes small kids go deaf.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.360
So I have no hearing in my right ear.

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:07.760
So I said, you're depriving me of receiving free speech

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.800
from others, because I can't see their lips move

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.600
when you order them to cover their mouths.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.520
To get around that, he made an exception

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:17.320
in paragraph 2B of order 55

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:18.960
that replaced the original order.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.400
And that exception said,

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.880
not only does anybody hearing impaired not have to wear a mask,

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.800
but nobody speaking to anybody hearing impaired

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.920
had to wear a mask.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.400
So I never had to wear a mask,

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:28.720
and people talking to me didn't,

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.520
and that took my standing, so I was booted on standing.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.680
But I still kind of won a little victory.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:38.520
Now, I went to play soccer over 56 league,

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.920
and I show up no mask.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.120
The ref says, where's your mask?

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.680
I said, I have an exception from the governor.

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.120
I don't have to wear one.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.280
And the ref walks away.

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:49.400
The other team, we start playing, hey, where's your mask?

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.520
Like, I don't have to wear one.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.960
I have an exception from the governor.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.600
They start swearing at me and yelling at me,

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.280
all 90 minutes.

01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.760
My own team is saying, John, just put a mask on.

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.960
They put me to the turf three times, artificial turf.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.400
My knees were bleeding,

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.120
like at least 20 square inches on each knee.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.800
The scabs lasted eight weeks,

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.760
and they were hard dirty fouls from behind.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.680
I went into the post office, not wearing a mask.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.600
She said, wear a mask.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.360
I said, I have an exception from the governor.

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.480
The clerk was like, okay, the people in line,

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.640
you're a sick man.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.160
They start yelling at me and stuff.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.840
I'm just trying to mail a package, right?

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:29.120
And then in Costco, put a mask on, like, I don't need to.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.680
I'm still visualizing the first one.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.360
You got a bunch of healthy middle-aged men

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:37.280
acting like a bunch of coward sissies saying,

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:39.960
put on a man, we're playing, are you outdoors or are you?

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:44.720
We're outdoors, growing around 110 yard soccer field.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.880
And all these guys, this sweat flying,

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:48.560
it's not going everywhere.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.880
People are bleeding, this bodily fluids everywhere.

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.040
And, you know, we play rough,

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.120
even though it's an over 56 league.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:59.000
And they put a mask on, like, what the hell is wrong with you?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.320
The mask isn't doing anything, grow a pair.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:04.600
It's absolutely delusional.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.280
I mean, this is how, like, what people say,

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.880
how did societies devolve into Nazi Germany,

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.560
out of Soviet Russia?

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.360
Look, it's not the same, but it's the same direction.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.680
I mean, that's in, you can convince otherwise,

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.200
and they're probably intelligent, in quotes,

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:21.840
professional men who, or, you know, adults who have jobs

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.520
and they're very educated and they're smart,

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:26.740
and they've succumbed to absolute insanity.

01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:31.740
I, when I went to law school, I'd be friended.

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:35.740
I'll just, I don't know if he wants his name out there.

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.740
Jeff Bowman.

01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:39.740
So, Jeff Bowman had his legs blown off

01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:42.740
in the Boston bombing.

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.740
And he has these mechanical legs.

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.740
There's a movie about him with,

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.740
oh, I forget the actor's name.

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:51.740
Jake Gyllenhaal plays him in the movie.

01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:54.740
And, you know, the Boston city,

01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.740
Boston Marathon bombing.

01:10:56.740 --> 01:11:00.740
So, Jeff, you know, these mechanical legs are not,

01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:02.740
it's tough to get around.

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:04.740
So, we step outside the classroom

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:07.740
after our first class in law school.

01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:10.740
And the arrows on the floor is telling him to go to the right.

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:11.740
He can't go to the left.

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:14.740
The classroom is the next one to our left.

01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:17.740
We had to walk the entire perimeter of the building

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:21.740
with his legs, right?

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:22.740
Why?

01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:25.740
I mean, these people are crazy with their stupid rules.

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:29.740
Like, COVID only flows in one direction in our building.

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:32.740
He couldn't just walk ten steps to the left.

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:33.740
I said, just go, Jeff.

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:34.740
Nobody's going to say anything.

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:35.740
You're like, nope.

01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:36.740
They want me to do this.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:37.740
I'm going to show all I'm doing is.

01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:39.740
So, I walked the whole building with him.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:41.740
These people are nuts.

01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:43.740
And they threw me out of law school for not getting the back.

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:45.740
So, I'm suing them.

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:47.740
What's the status of that lawsuit now?

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:51.740
Well, it was dismissed on standing, which is unbelievable.

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:53.740
I'm sorry.

01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:57.740
You, the one who suffered the consequences, don't have standing?

01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:58.740
Yeah.

01:11:58.740 --> 01:11:59.740
How do they rationalize that?

01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:06.740
Well, she rationalized it because I actually had a pro bono lawyer at the time who did the oral argument.

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:12.740
And the guy before me had some weak case where he was pro se, didn't have any money, didn't do any.

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:15.740
She was so nice and sweet and talking to him.

01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:16.740
And then I get up there.

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:17.740
My lawyer gets up there.

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:22.740
It's like, yeah, this is about being thrown out of law school from not taking the vaccine.

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:26.740
You should have seen the stern look on her face and the way she talked to my lawyer.

01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.740
She was decided already.

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:30.740
You know, but how do I not have standing?

01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:31.740
I don't know.

01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:32.740
I'm on appeal.

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:36.740
I got to, I got to figure out my, I got to do my brief for the appeal.

01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:39.740
I'm just trying to even, I'm just trying to think like a scoundrel.

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:40.740
I can't figure it out.

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:47.740
They're saying I don't have any standing because was a likelihood of success in the merits.

01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:49.740
That's for an injunction.

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:50.740
No, what did they say?

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:51.740
Nearly speculative.

01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:55.740
It's the merely speculative prong of luhan versus defenders of wildlife.

01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:56.740
You remember?

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:57.740
No, no, no.

01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:00.740
So redressability and traceability.

01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:01.740
It's garbage.

01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:07.740
They just, I have, if you read it, if Barnes read that, he would laugh for a day.

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:11.740
Well, you do flip it to me, not, not for, for a slow news day.

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:13.740
I'll, I'll, I'll talk about tomorrow.

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.740
I, I, so I go there for a year.

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:17.740
I paid $28,000 before I went a day.

01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:19.740
I said, I'm not taking the vaccine.

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:20.740
They wrote to me and said, don't worry.

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:21.740
You're over 30.

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:24.740
You don't have to take the vaccine in writing from the director of admissions.

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:27.740
They first said the director of admissions is not an agent of the school.

01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.740
He has no authority to tell you that.

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:30.740
Like what?

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.740
I guess they never heard her respond.

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:33.740
I got superior.

01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:34.740
Right.

01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:40.740
And then I had a contract and then, oh, the judge said, well, he got his year of school.

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:43.740
Like, no, I didn't say contract for a year of school.

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:45.740
I contracted for a degree after three years.

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:48.740
If I keep my grades up and pay my money, it's an options contract.

01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:52.740
You know, they, they, they're out of their minds.

01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:54.740
So there's, there's no other way.

01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:57.740
There's no other, but this is how you see a society devolved.

01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:01.740
I remember having this discussion with my father in March, 2020.

01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:04.740
You can see how quickly society goes crazy.

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:08.740
And then with enough indoctrination, fear porn media for three years.

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:13.740
It can convert even the holdouts from the beginning or turn others, you know.

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:16.740
Are you familiar with the Iqbal versus Ashcraft?

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:20.740
I know by name, but I will do some stronger refresh.

01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:23.740
If you, if you have a minute, you have a minute to discuss.

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:24.740
Absolutely.

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:25.740
Okay. Great.

01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:30.740
So Iqbal was a Pakistani who after 9 11 was grabbed in New York City and thrown into a federal.

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:31.740
Holding.

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:37.740
So they ended up deporting him back to Pakistan, but he says the guards beat him up.

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:38.740
A lot.

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:43.740
And that may have happened, but he sued under respond.

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:44.740
It's a period.

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:45.740
Right.

01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:48.740
The guards all the way up to the attorney general of the United States, John Ashcroft.

01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:55.740
The case was what was appealed and then appealed again.

01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:57.740
It went to the Supreme Court.

01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:58.740
Okay.

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:02.740
And the Supreme Court added a.

01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:04.740
A clause of.

01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:07.740
Not speculative, but.

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:10.740
The robustness of the claim on its face.

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.740
I'm not using the right words.

01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:14.740
There's one word plausible.

01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:16.740
It's plausible, right?

01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:18.740
You didn't say enough to say that it's plausible.

01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:22.740
Well, how come there's a 25 page limit and how am I going to say enough facts?

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:26.740
Anyway, Iqbal versus Ashcroft is the number one.

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:30.740
Assault on the rights of Americans.

01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:31.740
They can.

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:35.740
If you sue the government over abridging your rights, whether it's the first.

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.740
Second or whatever amendment you can choose.

01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.740
Iqbal will get you thrown out on standing.

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:46.740
No matter what, because it's left to the subjective whim of any judge to throw you out on standing.

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:48.740
Trump, not Trump, but the.

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:54.740
Texas and Missouri attorneys general that sued Pennsylvania for the election stuff.

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:56.740
You remember what they were throwing out on?

01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:57.740
Standing.

01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.740
You know what case they used to throw them out?

01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:01.740
It was Iqbal versus Ashcroft.

01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:04.740
I'm pulling this up while you're talking.

01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:05.740
I've got to.

01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:06.740
I got to make sense of it.

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:07.740
U.S. This is your case.

01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:09.740
U.S. District Court judge.

01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:13.740
Daniel Gorton sided with the state officials sued by John Paul Baudouin.

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:15.740
See your last year.

01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:20.740
He didn't have a quote standing to bring the case because he failed to show quote concrete

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:28.740
that they were not responsible for the way he was taken off the enrollment list of the school.

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.740
It's I mean, who.

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:31.740
Hold on.

01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:32.740
Hold on.

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:33.740
You got the wrong case.

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:34.740
Let me just.

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:37.740
So the case against the law school is in state court.

01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:40.740
This case is against the governor of the health commissioner.

01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:45.740
The chief medical examiner and four individual medical examiners for originally.

01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:47.740
I used criminal statutes for fraud.

01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:51.740
I also included civil action for deprivation and rights.

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.740
So the I've amended that complaint.

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:58.740
And it so they're saying I use third party doctrine.

01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:02.740
I said the school would not have enacted the vaccine mandate and all other schools,

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:16.740
which won't let me in because I don't have the vaccine would not have enacted their vaccine mandates had the state not committed fraud on the death certificates that inflated the COVID deaths and they hid the vaccine deaths.

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:18.740
Now, they're saying it's not.

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:37.740
It's not plausible. There's so that the third prong of luhan versus defenders of wildlife is redress ability that if the court sided with me and made the state admit the truth about these deaths, would that change the mandates.

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:40.740
And I say, yes, it would. And they're saying, no, that's only speculative.

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:49.740
Okay, no, I mean, I want to find the other decision where you lack standing to be the one who's.

01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:51.740
Yeah, it's a state court. It's a state court.

01:17:51.740 --> 01:18:00.740
Oh, man. Now, what, so what are you working on now? Tell us what you have. You got the real CDC.com. And you got a book. What's the book is called.

01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:02.740
The book is called the real CDC.

01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:07.740
And the subtitle is public health crimes, 2020 to 2022.

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:12.740
That will be out within a couple of weeks. It's on pre-order at that site, the real CDC.com.

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:18.740
I have another publication coming out called the risk of asking the stupid question though. Will it be available on Amazon?

01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:26.740
Oh, yeah, it's going to have to be. I didn't want to. I'm trying to get it. I tried to get away with it. It's been out for like a week. The website's been live.

01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:32.740
And there's just not enough traffic and people are telling me they won't buy it until it's on Amazon because then it becomes real.

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:43.740
I didn't mean in terms of caving to the evil of Amazon. I think Amazon to the extent it gives the independence voices is it's still a tool. You'd have to be cutting off your nose to spite your face, not to use it.

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:51.740
I just wonder if they're going to eat you. I don't want to give anybody any ideas, not that they need me to, whether or not they're going to just, you know, find a reason to suppress or ban your book from the platform.

01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:59.740
Oh, well, there's going through Amazon and it is going through Amazon. Books are a special thing at Amazon where they'll control everything about it.

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:07.740
I'm going to sell it on Amazon just as a product being sold on Amazon. So I don't have to worry about a best seller's list or anything like that.

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:17.740
But yeah, it'll be available there. And I have a bundle with another document I'm coming out with. And that is, oh, by the way, the book is for everybody. It's not for scientists and PhDs and stuff.

01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:30.740
I write and show data in such a way that normal people can read it. And it's real. It's not confidence intervals and p values and statistical methods, which I think are inappropriate anyway that's a long discussion.

01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:35.740
So the second document is called the CDC memorandum.

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:48.740
And notice of criminal liability, cease and desist and required action to the directors of the CDC FDA NIH 12 of their underlings. It'll be copied to at least six state attorneys general.

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:55.740
And I believe it will get before at least two grand juries to investigate the federal government.

01:19:55.740 --> 01:20:03.740
And it's got 100 and I'm up to 120 pages of factual allegations enumerated lots of data.

01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:13.740
You know, what oxygen level was somebody on this date and time. And then when were they put on a ventilator what drugs were they given. It's got all that it's got.

01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:25.740
There's 150 pages of 400 graphs of various causes of death like nobody in the world has seen this level of detail of not only data but individual people.

01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:28.740
And if they ignore it.

01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:32.740
They're notified once they get it right so it's I'm going to have somebody serve it to them.

01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:40.740
They will have been notified they can't say they didn't know. So the defense of ignorance of fact can never be used in the future.

01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:43.740
I believe it brought before a grand jury.

01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:47.740
And I believe a grand jury would find probable cause to indict them.

01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:53.740
So they have the opportunity to set the world right and say what these vaccines are doing.

01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:58.740
And I've proven it all there's enough in that in that document to burn them off.

01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:09.740
So that's that's called the CDC memorandum it's also available at that site the real CDC. You can buy it in a bundle. I have the price wicked low right now I have to change it because everybody's buying the bundle.

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:18.740
You know, it's really cheap. I see the question for the lazy people. Is this going to be available on audio?

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:21.740
Probably not unless I get a lot of requests.

01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:26.740
I don't know how graphs would translate into audio.

01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:34.740
The CDC memo that sort of it sounds like it's structured the way was it Steve Deese's The Rise of the Fourth Reich.

01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:38.740
Have you read The Rise of the Fourth Reich? No, I don't read much.

01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:44.740
I didn't read it either. I listened to it. But it's sort of it's a book that's drafted in like sort of an opening argument.

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:49.740
It's like a trial of the crimes of the COVID era.

01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:54.740
I hope I'm not mixing up books. I'm pretty sure that's what it is. And it's drafted like opening arguments witness testimony.

01:21:54.740 --> 01:22:05.740
It's a book documenting everything that went down and went wrong during COVID drafted in sort of like an argumentative or argument brief style. It's it's actually it's very good.

01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:08.740
And so what do you have coming so you got that?

01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:11.740
There's a near future.

01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:16.740
I'm driving up to New Hampshire right after this and going to talk to some state legislators.

01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:23.740
There's a bill I drafted that's I'll leave it there. But if it goes through, it'll be pretty good.

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:43.740
I'm also involved in a grand jury team out in Oregon. They're at the Fifth Circuit right now on appeal. It's a it's a petition to put information in front of a federal grand jury to investigate the FDA and CDC for much of the same type of fraud I describe.

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:46.740
In fact, my my data is a big piece of it now.

01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:56.740
And that's Dr. Henry Ealy, the Senator Kim Thatcher and Senator Dennis Lintagum state senators of Oregon. Those are the three petitioners or plaintiffs, if you will.

01:22:56.740 --> 01:23:03.740
What else do I have going on? I have a lot of other stuff going on too. So I get that the two books.

01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:07.740
Oh, my two lawsuits.

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:21.740
The bill up there. I've got things ready to go for three state attorneys general to start investigating this stuff. I mean, I have enough evidence to send it all down.

01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:23.740
It's ready, ready to go.

01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:35.740
Godspeed on that. I mean, it's this. I wish I hope I was just thinking today how like, you know, above and beyond the immunity from adverse effects or adverse events that's been gifted to these pharma companies.

01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:43.740
They haven't been gifted shareholder immunity. I'm waiting for the first shareholder lawsuits to be filed based on false representations.

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:53.740
Yeah, so I look at overall systems and if I can get any type of is my doggy. I thought I should have the door. Yeah, let's see. Let's see. I'm going to back it. Let's see the dog. Can you pick him up or?

01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:57.740
Come here, buddy. We're gonna have a dog off. I'm going to pick up.

01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:00.740
Cooper, he's backing up.

01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:04.740
Well, that's something you want. That's a beautiful dog.

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:06.740
Your backdrop is down.

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:08.740
Here we go.

01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:14.740
That's Cooper. That's a beautiful dog. Oh, let me zoom in a little bit. That's a good looking dog.

01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:20.740
Your backdrop fell down if you want to get it. Do you want me to take you out while you fix that or is that you're okay with?

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:22.740
I'll just fix you right now.

01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:25.740
I'm going to show you this one here.

01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:34.740
You got you got dogs.

01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:42.740
There's two types of dogs. That's mine right there sitting. He's got a dog bed and he chooses to sleep on my backpack next to this crock.

01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:45.740
And he's out and then we got the other one there who's sitting in her own.

01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:47.740
No, she hasn't done anything yet.

01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:54.740
John, you're doing amazing stuff. I don't know if people are discovering you for the first time today.

01:24:54.740 --> 01:25:03.740
You came highly recommended by people who I don't want to disclose publicly, but people that I trust privately and personally who said,

01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:09.740
highly recommended, trustworthy, smart and doing what very few other people are doing.

01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:10.740
Thank you.

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.740
Appreciate that. Thank you for pushing.

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.740
I wish I knew who that was.

01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:16.740
I'll tell you privately afterwards.

01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:17.740
All right.

01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:22.740
When I got, when I got, you know, I got the recommendation, I have to go to people that I trust to say,

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:25.740
am I, am I stepping in it or is this like, you know, legit?

01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:27.740
And they said totally legit and.

01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:32.740
Oh, there's so much chaos out there with, with people with fake stories and they exaggerate.

01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:36.740
I don't exaggerate anything. I'm very conservative with everything I say.

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:38.740
Well, but it's, it's about me.

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:42.740
You know, you don't know me. So how would you know that I'm being honest?

01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:47.740
No, but it's my, it's my own ignorance. Like, you know, there's levels to the, to the scrutiny of the stuff that we analyze.

01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:49.740
And I know some names and I have my own circle.

01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:55.740
They overlap within like this people that I've never heard of who I, you know, I, I, I wish I had heard of them and I wish I knew of them.

01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:58.740
I go back and try to catch up on as much homework as I can.

01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:01.740
But look, what you did with the weirdest.

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:06.740
The weirdest thing is like the guy came over to fix my internet yesterday. He's also an electrician.

01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:12.740
So he came down and helped me out on the side. But I'm, I'm sitting there trying to tell him stuff.

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:18.740
It's like, you know, I know I'm just a guy in my basement talking to you about an electrical problem.

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:23.740
But I'm also the guy that has the best data in the entire world on COVID vaccines and COVID.

01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:26.740
And nobody knows me. And I'm just, I'm just a regular guy.

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:33.740
But how do I tell people? Like, forget about all these studies, the randomized control peer reviewed, all that bullshit.

01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:36.740
It's all BS, excuse my language. I don't know how you feel.

01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:37.740
Oh, you're as far as much as you want.

01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:39.740
All right. That's all bullshit, man.

01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:44.740
If somebody dies in front of you and they have berry juice, I have this story about Tommy and the berry bush.

01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:47.740
You know, Tommy was supposed to be back from the other village.

01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:49.740
Get in and come back. They looked down at the end of the village.

01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:54.740
Tommy's laying under a berry bush with berry juice coming out of his, his mouth with foam coming out of his mouth.

01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:58.740
He's dead. And everybody goes, Oh my God, we have to have a funeral for Tommy.

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:01.740
Let's collect some berries and bake some pies for us all.

01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:04.740
Like, no, don't eat the freaking berries.

01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:09.740
It's obvious what happened. You don't need to know somebody dies in five minutes from the vaccine.

01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.740
What do you need to know?

01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:21.740
The problem is people are too heavily invested because they've sacrificed more than they ever wanted to sacrifice and they can't make themselves to admit it.

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.740
And with their own bodies, it's one thing. Like I could say, OK, fine.

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:28.740
I may have done something that I'd never do again had I known then what I know now.

01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:35.740
But at least I didn't do, you know, expose other people to that, the people who I'm entrusted to care for, for the people who've done it.

01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:40.740
How can you ever say, Oh my God, I might have done something that might have compromised.

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:42.740
You wouldn't believe this one.

01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:46.740
It's so, and I have a dust certificate in Western Massachusetts.

01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:49.740
A 16 year old girl died running cross country.

01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:51.740
Limple histiocytic myocarditis.

01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:54.740
OK, she died from myocarditis.

01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:56.740
Her pronouns are in her obituary.

01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:02.740
I'm sure she did everything that that whole cult said to do, including getting all her boosters and stuff.

01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:07.740
Well, there is a woman, Dr. Sarah Goff in Western Massachusetts who

01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:10.740
got some younger grad students together.

01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:18.740
They wrote a paper and in the paper, they're saying how doctors should be censored from talking about the vaccine in social media.

01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:22.740
You can't let doctors say anything bad about the vaccine in social media.

01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:25.740
That was 10 months after the girl died.

01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:28.740
Sarah Goff is her mother.

01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:31.740
That's the mother of the girl who died from myocarditis.

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:34.740
Now, I'm going out on a limb here.

01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:37.740
I think the vaccine killed her by myocarditis.

01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:45.740
And yet, she's going and getting a bunch of people in Western Mass is extremely liberal, by the way, the whole Amherst area.

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:47.740
Really, really bad.

01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:49.740
And they're in a cult.

01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:51.740
I can't imagine her own daughter.

01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:55.740
And now she wants all doctors silenced from social media.

01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:57.740
They're not allowed to talk about the vaccine.

01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:00.740
She can't face what she probably did.

01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:03.740
And to some extent, can't blame her.

01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:05.740
I didn't see this play.

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.740
My parents went to see this play in New York.

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:11.740
And all spoiler alert, the mother has been living with a hallucination of her kid the entire time.

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:18.740
And then you find out the kid's been dead from childhood, but the mother has been living with the memory, the ghost of the child.

01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:19.740
Yeah.

01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:26.740
How can you ever expect them to admit this to themselves and then also feel the wrath from everyone else who has had a similar experience

01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:28.740
or exposed their children.

01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:37.740
I understand that it's a total self-defense mechanism, but it's the most cowardly or self-preservation.

01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:40.740
They don't come forward.

01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:43.740
I've tried to talk to a couple of parents, and I gave up.

01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:44.740
And I'm like, you know what?

01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:47.740
I'm going forward with the data because I want to save the kids who are still alive.

01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:51.740
I want to reach the parents to make sure they don't vaccinate their kids.

01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:56.740
Everything has been so surreal and so weird the last few years.

01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:59.740
I can't even believe I have all this information.

01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:08.740
And, you know, I go back to St. Thomas Aquinas in libertarian theory, and that's where we need to be.

01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:14.740
Centralized anything is the least efficient system, whenever you centralize power and control.

01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:17.740
And the same thing happens with electrons on a circuit board.

01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:26.740
If you have a CPU, a central processing unit, it's less efficient than if you have a processing unit that handles the communications.

01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:30.740
One that handles graphics, one that handles arithmetic.

01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:34.740
You have a distributed processing system is always better.

01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:40.740
Now, central processing CDC FDA, they just killed a million people in the last three years.

01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:43.740
They killed a million in the U.S.

01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:45.740
They killed a million people.

01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:49.740
And a million people with how many life years left?

01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:53.740
I mean, not to be cynical, but the death of an 81 year old.

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:57.740
They don't have the life years, the productivity that the death of a 40 year old has.

01:30:57.740 --> 01:31:01.740
You just hit on a very big part of the chapter of mine.

01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:03.740
Life years lost is huge, huge.

01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:07.740
It's orders of magnitude more than COVID itself.

01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:10.740
Even if you count the COVID, they're lying about.

01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:14.740
You're right about the 81.3 in Massachusetts was the first.

01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:17.740
The average COVID death was above the average lifespan.

01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:18.740
I mean, it was six years.

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:20.740
Yep, it was.

01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:23.740
It's all in my book.

01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:25.740
And I explain systems.

01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:26.740
I'm a systems engineer.

01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:31.740
I think in economic, the intersection of what economics morality.

01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:36.740
So the side title of my second book is the pandemic is moral, not viral.

01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:43.740
We have a pandemic of immorality where people will accept all these things that are happening and just shrug their shoulders and walk away.

01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:45.740
Hey, your neighbor's kid was killed.

01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:49.740
You know, you might want to step forward and support him.

01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:52.740
You know, I got a move to New Hampshire.

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:53.740
I could get out of Massachusetts.

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:59.740
No, I had a high school friend had passed away and without identifying their sleep.

01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:06.740
And then, you know, like another friend who's sort of aligned is at the funeral and like they mentioned, like, did she?

01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:09.740
We know that this person has had some.

01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:10.740
Any any correlation?

01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:13.740
And then you immediately get the conspiracy theory stink.

01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:14.740
I were like, Oh, you're one of your Trump.

01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:15.740
You're a Trump supporter.

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:19.740
This conversation is over because it's easier to live with the light.

01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:22.740
Did you go over and talk to the funeral director?

01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:28.740
I did that a couple of years ago in twenty one is like, so, you know, you feel, feel them, feel them out for conversation.

01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:32.740
And then all of a sudden they open up like, Oh, you wouldn't believe the stuff that's going on.

01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:37.740
First of all, all these COVID deaths are BS and this is the funeral director.

01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:42.740
You know, you get a real conversation when you kind of tease it out with somebody in a small setting.

01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:51.740
There's no way they go public because the licenses you've given out are given out by the state for funeral directors.

01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:55.740
Imagine that's the only thing you've ever done your whole career and you're making good money.

01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:59.740
And if you say the wrong thing, the state can take your ability to make money.

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:01.740
I had a conversation with someone.

01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:07.740
I was biking through the forest and start, you know, and we start talking and they turn, they work in healthcare.

01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:10.740
And then it's immediate, like we're aligned.

01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:13.740
We start talking and I was like, do you want to come on to discuss this?

01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:14.740
I'm like, absolutely not.

01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:15.740
I'll lose my job.

01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:18.740
There's no way I'm doing this, especially in the political environment where it was.

01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:20.740
It wasn't Florida.

01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:23.740
John, do you have, do you have, will you have 10 more minutes?

01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:24.740
Yeah.

01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:25.740
Sure.

01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:26.740
Okay, so we're going to do everybody.

01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:28.740
We're going to go over to locals because there's a couple of questions there.

01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:31.740
I'm going to get some locals chat and we'll finish it up there.

01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:35.740
I was going to continue with some other topics, but it's, I'm not going to do that today.

01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:37.740
We're going to, we're going to end this on rumble.

01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:39.740
Come on over to locals, get some questions in there.

01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:41.740
Make sure that I haven't left any rumble rants out here.

01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:42.740
I haven't.

01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:46.740
And there's some chat in there and we'll get, we'll get some Q&A in locals.

01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:48.740
Everyone get, get, get your bus on over there.

01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:50.740
I'm going to end this on, on rumble.

01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.740
Thank you for those who are not going to come on rumble.

01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:53.740
Thank you for being here.

01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:54.740
I'll be live tomorrow.

01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:57.740
I'll cover the stories that I was planning on covering today, but this went.

01:33:57.740 --> 01:33:58.740
My goodness.

01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:01.740
I still, I still got questions and we're an hour and a half in.

01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:02.740
So I'm going to end this on rumble.

01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:07.740
Come on over to vivabarnslaw.locals.com for a little after party Q&A.

01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:08.740
Okay, done.

01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:09.740
See you all tomorrow.

01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:10.740
Okay.

01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:11.740
Now we're still here.

01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:12.740
We're still live.

01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:13.740
It changes nothing.

01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:16.740
And let me just make sure John on, on our locals chat.

01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:19.740
Victor Cardone says, Viva, outstanding interview.

01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:21.740
John is an amazing guy and is doing tremendous work for the people.

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:22.740
Thank you both.

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:25.740
I'm a health care provider in Massachusetts.

01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:29.740
My patients are experiencing so many issues, but everyone keeps pretending that the cause

01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:30.740
is unknown.

01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:32.740
I have never seen anything like this.

01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:34.740
And it continues.

01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:36.740
Okay.

01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:41.740
We had talked about like the dire stuff, the death.

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:46.740
And you can confirm unequivocally from what you have that the deaths of age brackets say

01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:48.740
the younger age brackets is.

01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:49.740
I don't know.

01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:50.740
100%.

01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:53.740
It's, it's, it's up.

01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:54.740
Objectively.

01:34:54.740 --> 01:35:01.740
It's, it's not up because we cleared out all the, the weaker, unhealthy younger people.

01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:04.740
So it's weird to talk about it like that.

01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:08.740
It's up in the context of healthy young athletic kids.

01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:09.740
Absolutely.

01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:10.740
It's up.

01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:15.740
The COVID there were, there were, as far as I understand, virtually nil virtually zero

01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:18.740
COVID deaths for 18 and under there might have been a dozen.

01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:21.740
I think if we're including Canada and the States.

01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:24.740
Other things like now early aggressive cancers.

01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:25.740
We didn't actually get into that.

01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:26.740
Oh boy.

01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:30.740
I presume you have stats on what do they call them turbo cancers, although that's a conspiracy

01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.740
theory term according to Wikipedia.

01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:36.740
So Kevin McCurnan is a genetics expert.

01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:41.740
He's the one who found the SV 40 promoter, which acts as a P 53 tumor suppressor.

01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:43.740
I don't even know what those words mean.

01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:47.740
All I know is that it causes and promotes cancer.

01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:51.740
Kevin ran the human genome project at MIT for a number of years.

01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:54.740
He's now chief science officer at medicinal genomics.

01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:59.740
He found stuff in the vaccine DNA that's not supposed to be there and it could potentially

01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:00.740
cause cancer.

01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:05.740
Now, when he was at the World Council for health, he said, there's one guy in the world who

01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:07.740
has dated back this up.

01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:08.740
His name is John Bode.

01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:12.740
So, you know, thank you, Kevin for saying that.

01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:17.740
So I had Jessica Rose on recently.

01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:19.740
She was talking about it.

01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:23.740
Unwell, inconclusive or unknown, the effect of the DNA particles.

01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:26.740
Why they're even there and what impact they might have.

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:27.740
Yeah.

01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:32.740
Why they're there is poor manufacturing practice or or that somebody knew that it was poor

01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:35.740
manufacturing process and allowed it to go, allowed it to go through.

01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:40.740
And when Kevin made that comment, by the way, Jessica's on the screen nodding her head like this,

01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:42.740
but, you know, really hard.

01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:43.740
Yeah, she explained.

01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:44.740
She explained.

01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:46.740
I mean, even how it could have gotten there in the first place or what the process was.

01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:49.740
It was, I understood the broad brush jokes, but I still don't understand the details.

01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:54.740
Well, from a legal perspective, there's a lower standard of proof with a strict liability

01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:59.740
manufacturing defect standard than a design defect standard, which would be like a reasonable

01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:02.740
alternative design kind of a negligence higher standard.

01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:06.740
So for your legal fans, that's a big difference in what needs to be proven.

01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:10.740
But with, let me just cut to the chase here.

01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:12.740
Where would it manifest first?

01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:13.740
Like I said, it's all about the blood.

01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:16.740
So your blood and blood forming organs being your lymph and marrow.

01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:21.740
So lymph node cancer in Massachusetts was over 400% of normal in 2023 so far.

01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:24.740
Last year, it was 258% of normal.

01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:26.740
Those are huge numbers.

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:31.740
I mean, it's, it's astronomically high and these are longer term things.

01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:34.740
So they wouldn't manifest right away.

01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:38.740
Whereas the acute stuff I told you with post hemorrhagic anemia and a cardiac arrhythmia,

01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:43.740
those occur shortly after vaccine, whether it's days, weeks, even months.

01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:46.740
But the cancers are going to take several months to a year, right?

01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:51.740
Even the turbo cancers take, you know, it's the three to 12 months or whatever.

01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:54.740
So now they're still going up.

01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:58.740
That means the body's still producing this craft.

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:00.740
Yeah.

01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:03.740
And so bone and bone marrow in Massachusetts.

01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:05.740
What's the other one?

01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:06.740
A lymph node.

01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:09.740
A lymph node cancer is the one that's wicked high.

01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:16.740
And which I guess makes not to play the hypochondric makes total sensory lymph nodes filter out,

01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:18.740
filter out to all the toxins in your body.

01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:19.740
I presume.

01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:20.740
Yeah.

01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:22.740
I mean, but the question is going to be this and it'll be there.

01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:24.740
It'll be the unprovable correlation.

01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:26.740
Is it the jab or is it?

01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:27.740
Is it?

01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:28.740
Is it the man made COVID virus?

01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:30.740
So let's assume that COVID is man-tinkered with.

01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:35.740
So maybe we're going to say it has some longer lasting impacts that are not found in natural

01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:38.740
coronavirus or non gain of function research coronavirus.

01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:44.740
How are you ever going to tell long term, what turbo cancers result from the jab possibly

01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:46.740
or from the COVID possibly?

01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:50.740
Well, there's a way to determine the genetic origin of cancers.

01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:53.740
I would hope that they will in the future determine.

01:38:54.740 --> 01:39:01.740
The signature of sequence that caused the initial cancer, but I don't know.

01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:06.740
I mean, what's really happening is your immune system is being suppressed.

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:11.740
Far more people are dying from pneumonia after jab than before jab, even with COVID.

01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:15.740
There are more people dying from, especially bacterial pneumonia.

01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:21.740
More dying with bacterial pneumonia because their immune systems were shot to hell.

01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:24.740
The vaccine destroys your immune system.

01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:29.740
You know, if your immune system is being primed to create a certain antibody for a certain

01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:33.740
disease that's not even around anymore and it's spending all its time doing that.

01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:40.740
You know, the other stuff you encounter, you're getting hit by like the RSV outbreak in 2021

01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:44.740
in the summer in the US South in kids that were not yet vaccinated.

01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:45.740
How did that happen?

01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:46.740
People talk about shedding.

01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:48.740
It's not the vaccine that's shedding.

01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:50.740
People are getting vaccinated.

01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:55.740
They're destroying their immune systems and the innate viruses that they still have in their

01:39:55.740 --> 01:40:01.740
bodies are allowed to grow to a point where they never had in 50 years since they had

01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:05.740
something and then the kids are picking it up from the parents because the vaccine reduced

01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:10.740
the parents immune system so that they could shed the RSV or the shingles or chicken pox,

01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:12.740
whatever, to the kids.

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:13.740
Everything's met.

01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:19.740
My reaction would have been I would have chalked that up to being isolated and not being allowed

01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:22.740
to play with other kids and eat dirt and being exposed to germs.

01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:27.740
But is there a way, I mean, if it's down south, I don't know what the lockdown restrictions

01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:28.740
were down south.

01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:31.740
Maybe that wouldn't even be the case to be the correlation.

01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:38.740
So the shedding of these viruses that have now been, that you haven't been able to fight

01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:41.740
off and that have been reproducing in your body.

01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:46.740
Yeah, in my opinion, that's, I mean, I'm not a doctor, not a biologist, but you carry all

01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:49.740
these things you have for your whole life, right?

01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:53.740
Why do really old people get shingles when they had chicken pox, when they were young,

01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:57.740
they've been able to fight at all their lives, but when their immune system drops when they

01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:00.740
get really old, then all of a sudden shingles comes out.

01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:07.740
But imagine if, you know, prematurely to that, you take a vaccine at 40 and it kind of wrecks

01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:09.740
your immune system in the same manner.

01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:10.740
Well, now you get shingles.

01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:14.740
It's like, why was there a shingles outbreak outbreak after the vaccines?

01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:19.740
Because we know that neutrophils and leukocytes drop after you get the vaccine for about,

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:22.740
you know, anywhere from five to 10 days.

01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:23.740
That's a fact.

01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:24.740
There's their papers on that.

01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:25.740
That's interesting.

01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:31.740
Now, I got shingles right before the outbreak, but I think that I got COVID if I did get it

01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:36.740
in December of 2019, where I was sicker than I'd ever been.

01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:40.740
And then I got shingles in February right before the outbreak, but certainly before the

01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:41.740
jab.

01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:47.740
I got it was, it was, it was like the worst poison ivy I've ever gotten, luckily, neck down

01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:48.740
and growing up.

01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:50.740
You didn't have the facial nerve thing.

01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:55.740
No, but I did get, I still have post her paddock neuralgia as they call it all over my right

01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:56.740
torso.

01:41:56.740 --> 01:41:58.740
So stabbing, tingling, and numbness.

01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:00.740
But it's not the, not the end of the world.

01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:02.740
But now that's an interesting thing.

01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:06.740
Would that also be the case, though, then from an infection of COVID, like possibly

01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:09.740
weakened immune system afterwards that can make you susceptible to shingles?

01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:10.740
Yeah, I'm open to anything.

01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:12.740
Like I said, I'm not a doctor.

01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:13.740
I'm hypochondric.

01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:15.740
I'm open to everything.

01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:21.740
What happened to me in 2020 in February, early February, my, my son said I was complaining

01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:23.740
of the worst test cold I've had in years.

01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:24.740
And I think, you know, he's right.

01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:26.740
I had a chest called two weeks later.

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:27.740
I was better.

01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:28.740
Still in February.

01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:30.740
I tried to get out of bed.

01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:31.740
I almost fell over.

01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:33.740
I actually did fall back on my bed.

01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:34.740
I grabbed the bed.

01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:38.740
I had vertigo so bad he had to walk me by my arm to the car.

01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:39.740
I couldn't move.

01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:42.740
Like, wherever I moved, the whole world was spinning around.

01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:44.740
I was on an IV for eight hours.

01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:46.740
They were trying to figure out what was causing it.

01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:49.740
And I think it was, I think I had the real COVID.

01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:52.740
I think I had, I do believe COVID exists.

01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:57.740
I think I had it because it attacked some kind of nerve in my ear or something that caused

01:42:57.740 --> 01:42:59.740
my balance to be blown out.

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:00.740
It wasn't vertigo.

01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:05.740
They wouldn't diagnose it as vertigo because I could turn my head left and right no problem.

01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:07.740
I couldn't rise up on my toes three inches.

01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:08.740
Only Z axis.

01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:09.740
That's it.

01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:14.740
I, when I got it in December 2019, I remember looking up in Cephalitis.

01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:18.740
I had been playing with a minnow that I hacked out of the ice in the townships in Montreal.

01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:22.740
I was like, did I get some sort of weird, but I thought, I mean, I had never been sicker

01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:23.740
in my entire life.

01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:24.740
And it was.

01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:27.740
Oh, now there's a couple of questions here.

01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:29.740
DTQC, and this is our locals chat.

01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:30.740
You can't see this, John.

01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:31.740
I'm going to read it aloud.

01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:33.740
I used to date a girl who worked at a hospital in Quebec.

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:35.740
She was told by the hospital staff.

01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:37.740
She was told by the hospital staff.

01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:41.740
We're told to put clothes on the face of patients who coughed too much.

01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:44.740
So the saliva would, so they wouldn't get infected.

01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:46.740
We can't trust our institutions anymore.

01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:49.740
If you go to the hospital, be sure your relatives are there to protect you.

01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:54.740
Especially now, since in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, you have presumed organ-donning

01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:57.740
consent laws, which can only, can only go bad.

01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:02.740
Time bandit says, this stuff is the reason I had a screaming match with my daughter to

01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:06.740
not take that poison when some were trying to coerce her into getting it.

01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:07.740
Dad won the argument.

01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:08.740
Thank God.

01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:12.740
And then Ginger Ninja, Ginger Ninja says, this has been incredible, John.

01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:15.740
I will be going down the bode wing rabbit hole.

01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:17.740
How I have never heard of you, brother?

01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:19.740
How have I never heard of you, brother?

01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:23.740
And then, uh, tort court or tout court says question.

01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:27.740
Can you tell us one of your stories from the funeral directors preparing the bodies?

01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:29.740
Have you seen the movie, uh, died suddenly?

01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:34.740
No, I, I, I had an issue with, I saw parts of it.

01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:36.740
Well, I, I, I said I've had my issues with Stu Peters.

01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:38.740
Um, that's what I wanted to say.

01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:41.740
So no, and I, and I, and I, I'm not like going to call out or anything.

01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:44.740
I just like Stu Peters has been wrong on three big things.

01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:48.740
Uh, one of which was including a certain problematic clip in that video died suddenly,

01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:51.740
which was predating COVID, which discredits a lot of otherwise good stuff.

01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:55.740
Uh, Pat King, he was wrong on Pat King and the snake venom stuff.

01:44:55.740 --> 01:45:00.740
That being said, uh, the funeral directors were talking about clots that they had never seen before.

01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:03.740
Other people were saying those clots were after treatments.

01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:09.740
So the, you know, I don't know what they put in there so that people were alleging that the funeral directors,

01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:16.740
uh, uh, you know, recounting of the clots was misrepresented because it was post treatment, not pre whatever they inject.

01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:20.740
But what were some of the things that the funeral directors were telling you, like just younger people dying

01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:22.740
in much greater numbers?

01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:24.740
Um, let me think.

01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:27.740
Um, or after all the clots.

01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:29.740
It's what they were dying from.

01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:32.740
I mean, I tried to go down a clot thing with them.

01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:33.740
Um, no.

01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:39.740
It just wasn't matching the narrative at the time.

01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:40.740
This is two years ago.

01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:43.740
I just, it was my friend's mother's funeral.

01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:49.740
And, um, you know, actually, oh my God, if you saw those pictures, she,

01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:55.740
she had, I thought they were tumors, but it's called granulation tissue at the site of injection,

01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:58.740
dose one at the site of injection, those two.

01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:01.740
I have pictures out there on my, on my sub stack.

01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:03.740
Kocandishina.substack.com.

01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:05.740
Uh, I didn't actually say that.

01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:07.740
I know you didn't say, well, you're going to give me the link.

01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:09.740
Did you send me an email with the links already?

01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:10.740
Uh, not that one.

01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:11.740
Okay.

01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:13.740
Well, I'll put them in the, in the pinned comments.

01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:15.740
I'm going to watch this on replay.

01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:18.740
You picked a bad name for, for easy.

01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:19.740
How do I say it?

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:20.740
How do I say it?

01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:21.740
How do I say it?

01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:22.740
But I don't even know.

01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:23.740
Okay.

01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:24.740
Cookin.

01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:25.740
Cookin.

01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:26.740
Cookin.

01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:27.740
That's the cocaine.

01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:28.740
That's very COQ, UIN.

01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:29.740
Or is it COCQ, UIN?

01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:30.740
No, no, you're right.

01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:31.740
COQ, UIN.

01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:32.740
Yeah.

01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:34.740
I'm saying it with the Parisian French, by the way.

01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:36.740
People saying cocking the cock in the dark.

01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:37.740
Okay.

01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:38.740
Uh, yeah.

01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:39.740
Great.

01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:40.740
Granny Lomas.

01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:41.740
That's sort of like, uh, is that like MRSA?

01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:44.740
Like that's sort of like an infection of the skin.

01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:46.740
Uh, wait a minute.

01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:47.740
What are we talking about now?

01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:48.740
The granular.

01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:49.740
Oh, really?

01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:50.740
No, no.

01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:51.740
Okay.

01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:53.740
So let me, let me go Google that because, you know, I had done it.

01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:55.740
The only guy that told me about it was Jerry Waters.

01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:57.740
He's a great doctor in Ireland.

01:46:57.740 --> 01:47:01.740
They took his license to practice because he's, he's truthful and honest.

01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:03.740
G-E-R-R-Y Waters.

01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:05.740
So he said, that's not a tumor.

01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:06.740
That's granulation tissue.

01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:07.740
And then I looked it up.

01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:08.740
I'm like, oh man, this guy's right.

01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:10.740
All the other doctors didn't tell me.

01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:13.740
You know, I, I, I don't know if, you know, you know, I were Bernstein.

01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:15.740
No.

01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:16.740
Oh, he's a Canadian doctor.

01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:19.740
They attacked along with, you probably know Patrick Phillips, right?

01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:22.740
Uh, yes, but not, I have to refer to my family.

01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:23.740
He's currently Patrick Phillips.

01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:25.740
And then, uh, Byron Bridal, Paul Alexander.

01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:26.740
For sure.

01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:27.740
I've, I've heard of.

01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:28.740
All right.

01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:29.740
So I, these guys all know me.

01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:30.740
Like it, it's funny.

01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:31.740
Right.

01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:35.740
It says nobody knows me except the people in this world.

01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:36.740
No.

01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:39.740
It's, it's, it's also the, the ability to break it down.

01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:41.740
Um, and make me, it's true.

01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:43.740
The scientists are not always the best at expressing the ideas.

01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:45.740
My, my wife who's a neuroscientist.

01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:50.740
This is like, this is one of the reasons why Anthony Huberman, either for good or for bad,

01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:54.740
is as successful as he is because sometimes he might break it down a little too simplistically,

01:47:54.740 --> 01:47:59.740
but he breaks it down so that people can understand versus listening to my wife talk about stuff.

01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:00.740
It puts me to sleep.

01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:01.740
That's what my book is for.

01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:02.740
It's for everybody.

01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:08.740
If they really want to know what's going on, like what drove this, not just the data and the individuals and the deaths.

01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:11.740
But how, as a society, did we get here?

01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:12.740
What laws made it happen?

01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:15.740
Um, the coercion from the medical boards.

01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:21.740
But oh, that, so imagine an inch and a half, about an inch wide and a half an inch thick.

01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:25.740
These little things grew out of her arm at the site.

01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:30.740
And they looked at just tissue growing outside of her arms at the sites of injection.

01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:33.740
And there's something called tumorogenesis.

01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:35.740
There's also something called angiogenesis.

01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:46.740
That means angio, if something is spurring angiogenesis, it's creating the blood vessels that would feed the granulation tissue or a tumor if it was cancer.

01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:53.740
So angiogenesis needs to occur in order to bring nutrients to the tumor or the granulation tissue to let it grow.

01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:55.740
And that's what happened.

01:48:55.740 --> 01:49:00.740
Something at that site, and I believe it's like what Jessica was saying, Kevin McCurnan,

01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:06.740
because the, we don't even know what's in these shots now, because the manufacturing is so bad.

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:07.740
The quality control.

01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:14.740
I want them all to get sued into oblivion, civilly, and then I wouldn't mind seeing a great many people behind bars.

01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:17.740
And like, I heard Pfizer's stock is down 50%.

01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:21.740
I wouldn't short it. I'm not into that, but, or even playing with it.

01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:24.740
Uh, they, they need to get sued for missing. I just think like,

01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:29.740
here's the plan for first to get them criminally, right?

01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:40.740
And we show that it was not intentionally then not only do you have to sue them, you have to pierce the corporate veil and claw back all the money from even, even people who had mutual funds, even them.

01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:47.740
We're talking trillions of dollars needs to be clawed back and given back to crude to reestablish the middle class in the United States.

01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:57.740
This is a huge endeavor. It has to be done. If we don't do it, we're going to be a class stratified country with only upper and lower. There's going to be no middle class left.

01:49:57.740 --> 01:50:07.740
Um, and it's going to take, uh, grand juries. So that's why I'm set on criminal. I'm set on grand juries. The civil cases will follow from that very easily.

01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:17.740
You know, you're going after the higher burden for criminal before civil, but yeah, I would say go after, go after civil. I'm going to go retweet.

01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:24.740
Albert Burla's April 1st tweet, 100% effective. I was like, if they knew this was false at the time, is that not market manipulation?

01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:42.740
So now, you know, to do that, you first have to get the prep act constitutionally stricken because it's, it's a violation of our constitutional rights. The government can't contract the way you're right to sue somebody who harmed you.

01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:51.740
And that's what the prep act is. There's only the willful misconduct exception in the prep act is the only way you can sue somebody. That's the liability shield, right?

01:50:52.740 --> 01:51:04.740
So it's, it's a complicated system where you have to go all the way to the root and then come back from that, because all the cases are going to be tossed based on the prep act.

01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:10.740
Man, yeah, that's why I'd love to talk the barn sometime.

01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:28.740
Oh, well, we're going to do part two of this and part two will go over the lawsuits. I cannot, I cannot, what's the word, bind contractually barns, but he's undoubtedly going to watch this because I catch up on Barnes's bourbon with Barnes when I go jog in in the morning and I'm sure he's going to catch up on this.

01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:37.740
This has been eye opening and amazing. And, you know, in as much as I did not know of your work thoroughly before the intro, everyone needs to know about what you're doing.

01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:46.740
I want to go after Iqbal and I'm just, I'm not a lawyer. I need help, but I have a good case. I think for Iqbal.

01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:58.740
Okay. Now, before we end this, because you got it, you got to get out of there. Let me see if there's any more Bill Brown puts in a meme and it says sometimes you just have to sit back, drink your beer and accept that people are fucking idiots.

01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:06.740
Right. That's not a bad meme. And that's it. Okay, chat. We're going to end this. I'm going to see if there's any other questions that I might have missed Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.

01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:18.740
Well, we might get this in as an extra topic for Sunday. And, okay, now we're going to end this. We're going to say our proper goodbyes and you got to get to New Hampshire for important stuff, John.

01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:24.740
Thank you anytime. And maybe one day we meet in person. We'll see who comes up which direction first.

01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:26.740
That sounds great.

01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:31.740
Send me the links. I'm going to put them in the pinned comment on both YouTube and rumble. I don't think I'm going to air this entire show.

01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:40.740
Everyone watching now, snip and clip. What I'm going to do actually is just post this section on rumble afterwards because so everybody can get it, but not live. That's the benefit of locals.

01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:46.740
And I'll put up all your links so people are going to find them. John, stick around. Stay here. We'll say our proper goodbyes. Everyone at locals.

01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:48.740
See you soon. See you tomorrow, peeps.
