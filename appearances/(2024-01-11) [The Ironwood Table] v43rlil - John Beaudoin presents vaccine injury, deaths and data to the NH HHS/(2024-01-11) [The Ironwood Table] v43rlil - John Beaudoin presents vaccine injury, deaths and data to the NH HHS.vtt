WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.520
Welcome.

00:04.080 --> 00:04.480
Hello.

00:04.480 --> 00:06.480
Thanks for having me.

00:06.480 --> 00:09.400
It's not that far, Massachusetts, hour and a half.

00:09.400 --> 00:13.560
So I plan on moving here, making New Hampshire my home.

00:13.560 --> 00:16.720
I plan on dying here, about 20 years in Connecticut

00:16.720 --> 00:19.800
where I grew up, and then about 40 years here.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.440
So I know time is short.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.280
Let me get to a few things.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.160
Before I speak about what I wanted to speak about,

00:25.160 --> 00:28.320
let me address the epidemiological aspect

00:28.360 --> 00:31.880
that was given testimony a few minutes ago.

00:31.880 --> 00:35.040
So when somebody says, no backs, this aren't human trial.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.760
OK.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.760
Some were trialed on the most healthy people.

00:39.760 --> 00:42.480
And there were a few people.

00:42.480 --> 00:45.240
What he's not telling you is, were they trialed on babies?

00:45.240 --> 00:46.560
How do we know they're safe for babies?

00:46.560 --> 00:48.360
Were they trialed on pregnant women?

00:48.360 --> 00:50.560
Were they trialed on people with clotting disorders?

00:50.560 --> 00:53.040
Naltzheimer's dementia.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.560
I'm going to get into some data that

00:54.560 --> 00:59.120
will tell you some numbers on those in Massachusetts.

00:59.120 --> 01:02.000
Also, flu and COVID differences, he said,

01:02.000 --> 01:03.640
oh, there's no differences between the trials.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.440
Well, then what is EUA for?

01:05.440 --> 01:06.840
Emergency use authorization.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.440
Why did it skip all the trials?

01:09.440 --> 01:11.440
So there are differences.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.640
So there's a disingenuous testimony that

01:13.640 --> 01:15.880
was given prior to me.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.000
I think he should consider.

01:19.720 --> 01:20.240
OK.

01:20.280 --> 01:24.320
So I'm a systems engineer.

01:24.320 --> 01:27.400
I made my career in putting large contracts together.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.680
So I understand various systems, not just engineering.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.600
So I have an MBA also.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.600
I put together the MK6LE.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.880
That's the Mark VI guidance control system

01:36.880 --> 01:39.640
for the Polaris nuclear missile.

01:39.640 --> 01:42.040
It's about a billion dollars that came from that deal.

01:42.040 --> 01:43.040
I was told not to do it.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.000
I did it anyway.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.280
And they pulled together Raytheon General Dynamics,

01:48.280 --> 01:50.840
Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Honeywell,

01:50.840 --> 01:52.640
and the prime contractor with whom I

01:52.640 --> 01:56.320
negotiated Draper Laboratory in Cambridge, Mass.

01:56.320 --> 02:00.600
The reason why I can understand the statistical methods

02:00.600 --> 02:02.800
they're used is because I used to use it

02:02.800 --> 02:05.280
against people in winning contracts.

02:05.280 --> 02:07.680
And the methods that are being used to tell you

02:07.680 --> 02:10.160
that these are safe and effective are, well,

02:10.160 --> 02:11.200
I was born in Hartford.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.640
So let me just quote somebody from Hartford,

02:13.640 --> 02:16.800
or at least his house is there, Samuel Clemens.

02:16.800 --> 02:21.120
They're three kinds of lies, damn lies and statistics.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.040
And they're fooling everybody with all these.

02:23.040 --> 02:23.840
Not everybody.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.360
They won't fool me.

02:25.360 --> 02:27.960
So here's some real data that I got from Massachusetts.

02:27.960 --> 02:32.880
I have 1 million unredacted death certificates, about 500,000

02:32.880 --> 02:36.040
from Massachusetts, 420,000 from Minnesota,

02:36.040 --> 02:40.440
and other the balance comes from Vermont.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.720
I'll just talk about Massachusetts for a minute.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.360
As far as safe and effective goes.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.360
I traversed the hierarchy of data and evidence

02:50.360 --> 02:51.760
from the individual case.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.520
That's a single death certificate,

02:53.520 --> 02:55.160
all the way up through all-cause, which

02:55.160 --> 02:56.800
is the highest level of hierarchy.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.280
So all-cause deaths.

02:58.280 --> 03:04.040
Yes, they were up quite a bit in Massachusetts in 2020.

03:04.040 --> 03:07.000
But they were also up in 21 and 22.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.480
All of a sudden, the causes of death

03:08.480 --> 03:09.920
that were causing the excess death

03:09.920 --> 03:14.080
shifted from a respiratory seasonal virus.

03:14.080 --> 03:18.680
So you have pneumonia deaths, ARDS, COPD.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.360
They were up in 2020.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.800
Well, what happened on a year boundary

03:22.800 --> 03:25.960
when the vaccines were introduced?

03:25.960 --> 03:30.200
Everything shifted to blood and circulatory.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.680
Blood and circulatory deaths.

03:31.680 --> 03:33.080
All of a sudden started going up.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.920
They didn't go up when COVID was around in 2020.

03:36.920 --> 03:40.360
They all of a sudden started going up in 2021.

03:40.360 --> 03:46.320
Cute post hemorrhagic anemia, thrombocytopenia,

03:46.320 --> 03:50.280
cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism.

03:50.280 --> 03:53.280
And I can tell you about the individual cases.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.480
Cassidy Baraka from Groton, Massachusetts,

03:55.480 --> 03:58.720
was injected in January 13.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.800
There's a report written about her.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.400
She reacted in five minutes, vomited for eight to 10 hours.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.120
Cassidy died on January 18, four and a half days later.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
You know what it says on her death certificate from Massachusetts?

04:15.000 --> 04:18.640
Complications of coronavirus-19 viral infection

04:18.640 --> 04:22.200
with no mention of the vaccine.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.040
Those are multiple federal felonies

04:24.040 --> 04:25.800
that the medical examiner, Stephen Schwartz,

04:25.800 --> 04:28.320
committed on her death certificate.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.400
Couple days ago was referred to the attorney general

04:30.400 --> 04:35.400
of Massachusetts for criminal investigation.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.760
That's just one.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.280
Brianna McCarthy, oh, Groton is right on the border

04:39.320 --> 04:41.120
of New Hampshire, by the way.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.840
So is Methuen.

04:42.840 --> 04:47.640
Brianna McCarthy, she reacted in hours with a headache.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.600
She went to the ER, they said, go home.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.960
You have a headache.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.920
She was so bad she went to the ER again.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.840
They said, here's some time when I'll go home.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.400
She didn't recognize her sister.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.240
So her family brought her in.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.400
She had intracranial pressure.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.880
They cut a hole in her head, did a crannyotomy.

05:04.880 --> 05:09.080
That didn't work because the cloths were all through her head.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.520
They kept her on life support for a while

05:10.520 --> 05:15.160
after she had had a seizure, paralyzed in half her body.

05:15.160 --> 05:18.400
And it's about two and a half weeks before she died.

05:18.400 --> 05:23.520
And that was in, she was injected in March 30, 2021.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.880
And she died on, I think, April 15.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.120
This is the official date of death,

05:27.120 --> 05:29.400
but she was brain dead in a few days.

05:29.400 --> 05:33.120
I just talked to her father a few days ago.

05:33.120 --> 05:37.320
So you would think a stroke like that that killed her

05:37.320 --> 05:38.600
would be rare.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.120
In fact, it says it in the summary

05:40.120 --> 05:43.160
that six doctors from the Harvard Medical College,

05:43.160 --> 05:44.840
Beth Israel, the Agnes Medical Center,

05:44.840 --> 05:49.160
wrote about her that's in the neuro-hospitalist journal.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.920
The title of which is Fatal Post-COVID mRNA Vaccine

05:51.920 --> 05:54.880
Associated Cerebral Ischemia translated to English

05:54.880 --> 05:58.640
means the vaccine killed her by stroke.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.360
Every paragraph in that report says

06:00.360 --> 06:01.680
the vaccine killed her by stroke.

06:01.680 --> 06:06.240
In fact, it says where thrombocytopenia is frequent.

06:06.240 --> 06:10.720
But in order to get published in a peer reviewed journal,

06:10.720 --> 06:13.440
because the journals are all captured by pharma,

06:13.440 --> 06:18.640
you have to write in the conclusion that's extremely rare.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.360
They also wrote there are several reports

06:20.360 --> 06:26.240
of several vaccines, COVID vaccines, causing these quads.

06:26.240 --> 06:28.800
Two weeks before Brianna was injected,

06:28.800 --> 06:33.000
Diane Dubois, 62 years old, died of acute intracranial pressure

06:33.000 --> 06:36.160
in the setting of thrombocytopenia.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.120
It says it in a dust certificate,

06:38.120 --> 06:40.520
but it's not coded by the CDC.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.600
Because the CDC, they have a software called Transax and Acne.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.640
It automatically reads the dust certificate, the English words,

06:47.640 --> 06:49.040
and converts it into codes.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.360
And the codes, they're international cause of death codes,

06:51.360 --> 06:52.960
ICD-10 codes.

06:52.960 --> 06:56.240
Those codes are the only way that the public knows

06:56.240 --> 06:58.760
what's going on because that's how you track data.

06:58.760 --> 07:03.160
Nobody's reading all the words that are in the dust certificates.

07:03.160 --> 07:08.760
Solomon Kizzetow died at 62 years old in Massachusetts

07:08.760 --> 07:13.680
on January 16, 2021.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.680
Idiopathic bronchod pneumonia in the setting

07:15.680 --> 07:20.080
of thrombocytopenia in a person vaccinated recently.

07:20.080 --> 07:24.280
So it says it, and it's coded, y59.0 viral vaccines,

07:24.280 --> 07:28.160
T88.1, other complications from immunization elsewhere

07:28.160 --> 07:31.040
are not classified.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.800
The CDC, however, says that nobody died from the vaccine.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.080
We don't have any reports.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.520
Yeah, because they turned off the software after that.

07:38.520 --> 07:45.160
And the next eight from Massachusetts that say,

07:45.160 --> 07:47.280
I'll look over here because you guys are engaged with me.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.080
Thank you.

07:49.080 --> 07:53.840
So yeah, no.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.960
So the others are, let's see,

07:57.960 --> 07:59.720
reacted to the vaccine in five minutes,

07:59.720 --> 08:02.640
didn't make it out of the clinic, dropped dead and cardiac arrest.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.960
That was not coded by the CDC.

08:05.960 --> 08:09.840
This is felony thorough fraud omission.

08:09.840 --> 08:17.560
And there's a number of 18 USC 1343, 241, 242, 1035, 1040.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.480
I could go on.

08:19.480 --> 08:24.400
It's also murder because what I should tell you guys,

08:24.400 --> 08:27.280
you probably already know this, as officers of the courts

08:27.280 --> 08:29.800
in New Hampshire, you have legal duty to act on information

08:29.800 --> 08:32.640
and belief that the public is in danger.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.680
And knowing of this fraud, and I do have a document

08:35.680 --> 08:38.760
called the CDC Memorandum, it'll be published once I

08:38.760 --> 08:41.760
redact the names from certain names from Minnesota.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.760
The other names will be in there.

08:43.760 --> 08:47.080
You can have the official copy without name redactions.

08:47.080 --> 08:50.000
It'll be served to the directors of the CDC FDA.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.960
NIH, 12 of their underlings, six state attorneys general,

08:53.960 --> 08:56.680
and perhaps Mr. Formella would like it to.

08:56.680 --> 08:58.320
I'll be happy to drop it off.

08:58.320 --> 09:03.320
I met with him, Representative Paul Sov and Gerard

09:03.320 --> 09:03.960
brought me in.

09:03.960 --> 09:08.040
I spoke with Attorney General Formella for 45 minutes.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.320
It was supposed to be a half-an-hour meeting.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.680
They extended the meeting.

09:11.680 --> 09:12.600
It went pretty well.

09:12.600 --> 09:13.280
They understood.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.120
This was March of last year.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.440
I showed him the likely deaths of New Hampshire residents

09:18.440 --> 09:20.360
who died in Massachusetts hospitals.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.320
I have all the records.

09:21.320 --> 09:25.560
First names, middle names, last names, parents names.

09:25.560 --> 09:28.040
When somebody from the state says this is safe and effective,

09:28.040 --> 09:29.040
oh, no, he didn't say that.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.280
He danced around the question.

09:30.280 --> 09:31.200
I forgot.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.240
He wouldn't answer your direct question.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.920
Will he yes or no?

09:34.920 --> 09:40.760
Please don't refer to other previous testimony just yours.

09:40.760 --> 09:41.480
Oh, OK.

09:41.480 --> 09:42.120
Thank you.

09:42.120 --> 09:45.000
Sorry about that.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.320
So this bill 319 is a good step forward.

09:51.400 --> 09:56.400
It's very important because drugs should be tested before they're given.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.320
I'm deaf in one ear.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.840
I have been since I was four years old.

09:58.840 --> 10:01.400
They gave me a shot of streptomycin and penicillin mixed together

10:01.400 --> 10:02.560
for the Hong Kong flu.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.040
I didn't have the flu.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.520
They wanted to make money on a shot.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.600
So they gave me a prophylactic of antibiotics

10:09.600 --> 10:12.320
without me having anything.

10:12.320 --> 10:16.600
And they found in 1968 you cannot mix streptomycin and penicillin.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.880
It makes small kids go deaf.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.040
So thousands of kids went deaf.

10:20.040 --> 10:23.280
I'm lucky I have one ear since I was four.

10:23.280 --> 10:25.760
Now, I mean, who cares about me in 59?

10:25.760 --> 10:27.400
I'm running to the end, right?

10:27.400 --> 10:29.360
We got kids getting injected.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.720
I told you about Cassidy, Brianna was 30.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.320
Oh, by the way, on Brianna's death certificate,

10:34.320 --> 10:35.720
it doesn't say the vaccine killed her.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.600
It said COVID killed her.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.400
They lied again.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.480
It's double fraud, fraud by omission, fraud of commission.

10:41.480 --> 10:45.080
So you have to ask yourselves, are you here to support the people

10:45.080 --> 10:46.680
or the pharma companies?

10:46.680 --> 10:48.760
And do you have a legal duty to act for the safety

10:48.760 --> 10:49.760
of the people of New Hampshire?

10:49.760 --> 10:50.800
And that's what this bill does.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.480
It acts for the safety of the people of New Hampshire.

10:53.480 --> 10:54.920
Now, I know I only have a few minutes

10:54.920 --> 10:57.880
and probably running to the end of your patients with me.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.120
I do appreciate your time.

11:00.120 --> 11:03.800
Nobody in the world has the data that I've compiled.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.120
Kevin McCurnan is Chief Science Officer

11:06.120 --> 11:09.920
of Medicinal Genomics, also run a human genome project at MIT.

11:09.920 --> 11:13.480
He gave testimony at the World Council for Health.

11:13.480 --> 11:15.560
He said there's one guy in the world who

11:15.560 --> 11:17.320
has the data to show this.

11:17.320 --> 11:20.760
And that's me.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.920
Secondary malignant neoplasm of the lymph nodes,

11:23.920 --> 11:26.080
ICD-10 code C77.9.

11:26.080 --> 11:31.440
It's up 400% of normal in 2023 in Massachusetts.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.600
You've heard of the term turbo cancers probably

11:33.600 --> 11:36.160
being caused by these vaccines.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.840
You may not know the reasons.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.600
There's a theory behind that.

11:39.600 --> 11:44.520
The SV40 promoter that's been found and verified

11:44.600 --> 11:49.480
10 labs internationally, the Simeon virus, it's a plasmid.

11:49.480 --> 11:54.640
It's a piece of protein that was found.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.360
It's not supposed to be in there.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.120
It's contamination.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.720
They're shipping contaminated products

12:01.720 --> 12:04.160
and injecting people on mass.

12:04.160 --> 12:08.880
And it could likely cause cancers and other things.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.520
I mean, I can tell you the whole blood system is

12:10.600 --> 12:13.880
dysregulated from hematopoietic cells,

12:13.880 --> 12:19.000
which lead to the creation of every type of thrombus.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.920
I'll try to use regular words.

12:20.920 --> 12:23.600
Platelets, red cells, white cells.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.040
It's the basis for all of them.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.960
When you get a dysregulation at that level,

12:26.960 --> 12:29.720
that's why you're seeing so many different systemic problems

12:29.720 --> 12:31.920
in the body where people say, well, it can't be from the vaccine.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.360
There's so many different things.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.040
No, it's really just one or two things.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.720
But it manifests in other things

12:37.720 --> 12:40.120
because the blood goes everywhere in your body.

12:40.120 --> 12:44.040
So I have to end at some point.

12:44.040 --> 12:46.880
This bill is actually the first step, and it's great.

12:46.880 --> 12:49.480
But if anybody wants to talk to me after,

12:49.480 --> 12:52.320
I'm willing to talk at all times.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.440
And I have talked for four hours straight.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.200
I did type my name into the rumble search bar.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.960
70 videos will come up.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.800
I've been interviewed on podcasts around the world.

12:59.800 --> 13:03.960
I've presented to doctors and scientists around the world,

13:03.960 --> 13:05.320
thousands of them.

13:05.320 --> 13:09.040
And no one has refuted my findings in data

13:09.040 --> 13:10.840
because it's just truth.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.520
I don't do statistics.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.200
They're not statistics.

13:14.200 --> 13:18.680
You know, Ian was in Bellingham, 11 years old.

13:18.680 --> 13:22.200
He got the vaccine, got a booster.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.960
This was November of last year, the year before, sorry,

13:25.960 --> 13:30.920
21, 22.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.480
Anyway, he died on December 3rd.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.640
The family donated his heart and they pulled it out.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.320
They couldn't use it.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.160
It was full of clots.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.960
To not care about an 11-year-old child

13:40.960 --> 13:44.000
and to listen to testimony like that and just not

13:44.000 --> 13:46.280
pay attention, it's kind of blows my mind

13:46.280 --> 13:47.640
that the people can do that.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.640
So thank you for your time.

13:49.640 --> 13:50.880
Thank you.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.920
And any questions?

13:52.920 --> 13:54.600
Any questions from the committee?

13:54.600 --> 13:55.360
See you in then.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.440
Not at this time.

13:56.440 --> 13:56.920
Thank you.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.840
Thank you.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.760
We only have two speakers left.
