00:00.000 --> 00:06.200
Recently, one of these citizens, a very highly educated individual, used for your freedom

00:06.200 --> 00:14.200
of information act requests in order to get all of the death certificate data to see why

00:14.200 --> 00:15.200
are people dying?

00:15.200 --> 00:20.180
Did anything change when COVID hit and then when the vaccine program started and maybe

00:20.180 --> 00:21.780
even remdesivir?

00:21.780 --> 00:25.680
There's a lot of information when we look at how people died.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.840
This is him in, is it in Massachusetts?

00:27.840 --> 00:34.240
I think it's in Massachusetts, okay, this is him in front of the legislator in Massachusetts.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.560
Watch this.

00:35.560 --> 00:37.760
Here's some real data that I got from Massachusetts.

00:37.760 --> 00:45.320
I have 1 million unredacted death certificates, about 500,000 from Massachusetts, 420,000

00:45.320 --> 00:49.160
from Minnesota and other, the balance comes from Vermont.

00:49.160 --> 00:53.800
What happened on a year boundary when the vaccines were introduced?

00:53.800 --> 00:58.040
Everything shifted to blood and circulatory.

00:58.040 --> 01:00.760
Blood and circulatory deaths, all of a sudden started going up.

01:00.760 --> 01:06.200
They didn't go up when COVID was around in 2020, they all of a sudden started going up

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
in 2021.

01:07.200 --> 01:15.920
I keep post hemorrhagic anemia, thrombocytopenia, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, pulmonary

01:15.920 --> 01:21.000
embolism, and I can tell you about the individual cases.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.440
Cassidy Baraka from Groton, Massachusetts, was injected in January 13.

01:25.440 --> 01:31.400
She reacted in five minutes, vomited for eight to ten hours.

01:31.400 --> 01:35.720
Cassidy died on January 18, four and a half days later.

01:35.720 --> 01:39.920
You know what it says on her death certificate from Massachusetts?

01:39.920 --> 01:46.960
Complications of coronavirus-19 viral infection, with no mention of the vaccine.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.720
Those are multiple federal felonies that the medical examiner, Stephen Schwartz, committed

01:50.720 --> 01:52.880
on her death certificate.

01:52.880 --> 01:57.760
A couple days ago, it was referred to the Attorney General of Massachusetts for criminal investigation.

01:57.760 --> 02:02.400
Brianna McCarthy, she reacted in hours with a headache.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.840
She went to the ER, they said, go home.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.200
You have a headache.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.040
She was so bad, she went to the ER again.

02:09.040 --> 02:13.640
They said, here's some time when I'll go home, she didn't recognize her sister.

02:13.640 --> 02:18.440
So her family brought her in, she had intracranial pressure, they cut a hole in her head to

02:18.520 --> 02:24.280
the craniotomy, and that didn't work because clots were all through her head.

02:24.280 --> 02:28.680
They kept her on life support for a while after she had had a seizure, paralyzed in

02:28.680 --> 02:33.600
half her body, and it's about two and a half weeks before she died.

02:33.600 --> 02:40.200
And that was in, she was injected in March 30, 2021, and she died on I think April 15.

02:40.200 --> 02:44.760
This is the official date of death, but she was brain dead in a few days, which is fatal

02:44.760 --> 02:49.520
post-COVID mRNA vaccine associated cerebral ischemia, translated to English means the

02:49.520 --> 02:53.040
vaccine killed her by stroke.

02:53.040 --> 02:57.840
Every paragraph in that report says the vaccine killed her by stroke, two weeks before Brianna

02:57.840 --> 03:02.880
was injected, Diane Dubois, 62 years old, died of acute intracranial pressure in the

03:02.880 --> 03:05.960
setting of promocytopenia.

03:05.960 --> 03:10.520
It says it's an inner dust certificate, but it's not coded by the CDC.

03:10.520 --> 03:14.160
As the CDC, they have a software called Transax and AFNI.

03:14.160 --> 03:18.840
It automatically reads the desert certificate, the English words, and converts it into codes.

03:18.840 --> 03:22.920
And the codes, they're international cause of death codes, ICD-10 codes.

03:22.920 --> 03:27.200
Those codes are the only way that the public knows what's going on because that's how

03:27.200 --> 03:28.840
you track data.

03:28.840 --> 03:33.080
Nobody's reading all the words that are in the desert certificates.

03:33.080 --> 03:43.680
Solomon Quizzito died at 62 years old in Massachusetts on January 16, 2021.

03:43.680 --> 03:50.080
Idiopathic bronchod pneumonia in the setting of promocytopenia in a person vaccinated recently.

03:50.080 --> 03:55.600
So it says it, and it's coded, y59.0 viral vaccines, T88.1.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.360
The CDC, however, says that nobody died from the vaccine.

03:58.360 --> 04:02.800
We don't have any reports yet because they turned off the software after that.

04:02.800 --> 04:08.880
So the others are, let's see, reacted to the vaccine in five minutes, didn't make

04:08.880 --> 04:11.560
it out of the clinic, dropped dead and cardiac arrest.

04:11.560 --> 04:14.880
That was not coded by the CDC.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.440
This is felony thorough fraud.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.800
We got kids getting injected.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.400
I told you about Cassidy, Brianna was 30.

04:21.400 --> 04:25.720
Oh, by the way, on Brianna's death certificate, it doesn't say the vaccine killed her.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.600
It said COVID killed her.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.600
They lied again.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.920
It's double fraud, fraud by omission, fraud of commission.

04:30.920 --> 04:35.400
You know, Ian was in Bellingham, 11 years old.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.920
He got the vaccine, got a booster.

04:38.920 --> 04:42.200
This was November of last year, not the year before.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.960
Anyway, he died on December 3rd.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.400
The family donated his heart.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.400
They pulled it out.

04:47.400 --> 04:48.400
They couldn't use it.

04:48.400 --> 04:53.280
It was full of cloths to not care about an 11 year old child and to listen to testimony

04:53.280 --> 04:55.960
like that and just not pay attention.

04:55.960 --> 04:59.000
It's kind of blows my mind that the people can do that.

04:59.000 --> 05:08.040
At the heart of that amazing testimony was John Bowdwin and he joins me now.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.040
Thanks for having me, sir.

05:09.040 --> 05:14.520
Hey, man, it's always just an honor to meet a fellow warrior that is just, you know, doing

05:14.520 --> 05:16.320
your part.

05:16.320 --> 05:20.200
Great video, by the way, you know, lots of people looking online.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.200
Just amazing.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.200
Powerful.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.200
Yeah.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.200
I have to thank Anne Forti.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.200
She's somebody on Twitter.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.200
She follows me.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.720
And she cut it down from 14 minutes to four minutes.

05:28.720 --> 05:29.720
Wow.

05:29.720 --> 05:30.720
And did a great job.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.880
And it's over a third of a million views now.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.080
It's over 400,000, I think.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.080
Yeah.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.080
And that's just that video.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.200
It's been translated into Japanese, French, Spanish, and German.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.520
It's going all around.

05:40.520 --> 05:41.520
Amazing.

05:41.520 --> 05:42.520
That's fantastic.

05:42.520 --> 05:43.520
Congratulations.

05:43.520 --> 05:44.520
Thank you.

05:44.520 --> 05:45.520
So important.

05:45.520 --> 05:49.960
Can I just ask, like, when I watched something like that, what was the reaction?

05:49.960 --> 05:55.000
I mean, you know, by this panel, I mean, a lot of times you reduced to three minutes.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.880
For some reason, you got 14 minutes, which is always a good sign to me that you had

05:58.880 --> 06:01.080
some time to lay this out.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.960
But what was the response?

06:03.960 --> 06:09.040
I was a little bit emotional, giving that testimony, because I was looking to my left.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.880
The two state senators to my left, there were two to my left, three to my right.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.640
And the two to my left wouldn't look at me.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.920
Just would not look me in the eyes.

06:17.920 --> 06:22.280
And she looked up real fast and really fast looked down, started typing on the keyboard.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.280
They whispered to each other.

06:23.280 --> 06:27.760
She pulled out a binder, started rifling through it, just refused to listen to anything.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.080
So you know, I was sad.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.240
I was angry.

06:30.240 --> 06:34.560
But then eventually, throughout the testimony, you hear me say, I'm kind of shocked that

06:34.560 --> 06:36.920
they can't even listen to the testimony of children dying.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.320
They don't want to know it.

06:38.320 --> 06:41.800
But I looked to the right and they were engaged completely.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.880
And I didn't know it was down party lines.

06:43.880 --> 06:47.320
I could have guessed, but you know, you can figure it out.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.720
So yeah, it was tough.

06:49.720 --> 06:53.240
Normally when I speak to somebody, they look me in the eyes and we have a conversation

06:53.240 --> 06:54.240
right?

06:54.240 --> 06:55.240
Yeah.

06:55.240 --> 07:01.520
I've had similar experiences when you speak to, you know, these government bodies.

07:01.520 --> 07:07.320
And you know, it is really weird that it has become, you know, a political, I've seen

07:07.320 --> 07:11.320
all sides when I was a liberal, I used to wonder why we, you know, can't talk about pollution

07:11.320 --> 07:13.200
and water and air.

07:13.200 --> 07:17.920
And now I'm seeing now it's pollution in your bloodstream and suddenly the tables have

07:17.920 --> 07:18.920
turned.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.640
I really pray that we get out, we get past this division.

07:22.640 --> 07:27.240
It's dividing lines that, you know, these are issues that are just human issues.

07:27.240 --> 07:31.480
And if we could just listen and get outside, I think really turn off the television.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.480
Exactly.

07:32.480 --> 07:33.480
It's a huge part of it, right?

07:33.480 --> 07:34.480
That's dividing us.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.960
I think we'd realize we need to come together.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.440
I want to talk about this data.

07:38.440 --> 07:43.600
So first of all, what, how much, you know, what did you get and what is it you have in

07:43.600 --> 07:44.920
your hands right now?

07:44.920 --> 07:50.920
So almost a year and a half ago, almost two years ago, I got about 420,000 Massachusetts

07:50.920 --> 07:52.240
death certificates.

07:52.240 --> 07:55.040
And since then I've had updates and now I have over 500.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.040
Unredacted.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.040
Yes.

07:57.040 --> 08:02.240
I have every, I'm so used to legally as we're in this process with FOIA that the complaint

08:02.240 --> 08:06.400
is that, you know, there's names that it's not de-identified, then you got to figure out

08:06.400 --> 08:07.400
how to get it de-identified.

08:07.400 --> 08:10.920
But in this case, a lot of that was just wide open.

08:10.920 --> 08:11.920
Yeah.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.560
In this case, I did eight public records requests.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.920
It's a state version of a FOIA that you just mentioned moments ago.

08:16.920 --> 08:21.640
And those public requests were a number of, tell me the vaccination dates of these people

08:21.640 --> 08:27.400
and tell me why Girish Navani was on the governor's reopening advisory board when he basically

08:27.400 --> 08:32.800
is a false claims act violation, had to pay $155 million, totally separate story.

08:32.800 --> 08:36.280
And I asked for the entire state database of death certificates.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.040
How long did it take for them to produce that?

08:39.040 --> 08:40.040
Days.

08:40.040 --> 08:41.040
Really?

08:41.040 --> 08:42.040
I was shocked.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.760
I was like, they gave me none of the others.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.200
They only gave me the biggest one that I wanted.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.200
What?

08:47.200 --> 08:48.200
And wow.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.200
Okay.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.200
I'll take it.

08:50.200 --> 08:51.200
That's great.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.200
Yeah.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.200
I ran them through other people had submitted the requests.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.200
Okay.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.200
Eight different names.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.080
If they were all from me, they would have seen them all from me.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.080
I want to correct, too.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.240
I had said that there was a Massachusetts hearing was a New Hampshire.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.240
It was a New Hampshire hearing.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.240
Okay.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.240
Right.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.240
Right.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.240
I live in Massachusetts.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.240
Got it.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.240
I was invited up to speak for Emily Phillips-Bill.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.240
It's SB 319.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.240
Okay.

09:10.240 --> 09:16.160
I believe speaking next week on Thursday for a bill that I wrote.

09:16.160 --> 09:24.200
House Bill 1661, Jason Gerhard submitted it, has Yuri Polisov also.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.600
These guys brought me up to speak to the Attorney General.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.960
We had a 45-minute meeting, private meeting.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.120
It went pretty well.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.280
Talked about it some other time.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.280
Right.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.880
But they're very involved.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.840
And so I'll be speaking again in New Hampshire next week.

09:37.840 --> 09:41.920
Also be speaking at the Massachusetts legislature on Monday.

09:41.920 --> 09:42.920
Yeah.

09:42.920 --> 09:43.920
Jancy Lindsey put it together.

09:43.920 --> 09:44.920
Great.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.360
Mark's will be speaking as well.

09:46.360 --> 09:47.360
Wonderful.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.360
We've had her on the show.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.960
I mean, I think what's amazing now is the conversation's definitely changed.

09:50.960 --> 09:55.200
I mean, when I started when, you know, I was first touring this country with my documentary

09:55.200 --> 09:59.600
Vaxxed, you really, we weren't really getting any attention from either side of the aisle.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.240
It was just, this is crazy talk.

10:01.240 --> 10:03.480
This is conspiracy theories, you know.

10:03.480 --> 10:07.200
But a lot of moms, I will say, really just stayed in there.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.200
Started understanding the political system, started bringing bills.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.200
Right.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.200
And we kept visiting.

10:12.200 --> 10:16.920
You know, we were already moving the needle, COVID, I think, really opened a lot of people's

10:16.920 --> 10:17.920
minds.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.720
And I think that's why this data is so important.

10:19.720 --> 10:26.160
So let's get down to, you know, you know, just sort of on, you know, in bulletting out what

10:26.160 --> 10:30.040
are the top discoveries you would say if you were like the elevator pitch, someone is

10:30.040 --> 10:32.680
just like, so what did you find?

10:32.680 --> 10:36.440
What do you think is the most important find in all this now a million deaths certificates

10:36.440 --> 10:38.280
between three different states?

10:38.280 --> 10:39.280
Right.

10:39.280 --> 10:40.280
Okay.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.520
Two things that I'll do.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.240
One is people and the other's data.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.240
Okay.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.240
All right.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.680
In my book, I start out with people.

10:46.680 --> 10:50.680
We talk about Cassidy and then three different strokes and three women named.

10:50.680 --> 10:51.920
And then I get into the data.

10:51.920 --> 10:56.240
And the reason for that is there's a lot of PhDs and MDs and they're all smarter than

10:56.240 --> 10:57.240
I am.

10:57.240 --> 11:01.520
I need to do something different because we need to get the evidence to the legislators,

11:01.520 --> 11:02.520
to the courts.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.920
I'm looking to get a grand jury investigation.

11:04.920 --> 11:10.240
I'm on a team with Dr. Henry Ili, Senators Kim Thatcher and Dennis Lint that come in Oregon.

11:10.280 --> 11:15.760
And they have a lawsuit to petition the court for a grand jury investigation of the CDC

11:15.760 --> 11:16.760
and FDA.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.760
Great news happened.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.760
Trying to do that.

11:18.760 --> 11:19.760
Yep.

11:19.760 --> 11:26.280
So I have the book coming out and the thesis of the book I'll tell you is the symptom spectrum

11:26.280 --> 11:32.200
profile that is the causes of death across society, across in this case, Massachusetts

11:32.200 --> 11:36.320
changed on a year boundary from 2020 to 2021.

11:36.320 --> 11:40.160
Also the age spectrum profile and the seasonality profile.

11:40.160 --> 11:43.440
So the profile of deaths, what do they look like?

11:43.440 --> 11:49.880
All of a sudden on a year boundary, it's starkly changed from respiratory in 2020, year of

11:49.880 --> 11:55.360
COVID to circulatory, if you believe COVID or hospital protocol deaths, whatever, I don't

11:55.360 --> 11:57.800
want to upset people that don't believe in COVID.

11:57.800 --> 12:03.680
But the age spectrum profile dropped about 10 years, 10 years of the excess deaths.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.960
So the when you're looking at here, this is the slide, you can sort of sort of take us

12:06.960 --> 12:07.960
what we're looking at here.

12:07.960 --> 12:08.960
Oh, yes.

12:08.960 --> 12:13.200
So on the top, you have all cause death, COVID and pneumonia.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.200
Yep.

12:14.200 --> 12:18.640
And you see each bar represents a year and the years are 2015 through 2022.

12:18.640 --> 12:19.640
Right.

12:19.640 --> 12:22.680
And as you get to that big spike in the top left there under all cause deaths, that's

12:22.680 --> 12:23.840
the year of 2020.

12:23.840 --> 12:24.840
Right.

12:24.840 --> 12:29.920
Massachusetts had about 8,800, close to 9,000 excess deaths and only a nine week period

12:29.920 --> 12:33.120
from mid-March to mid-June, that's where that spike is.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.120
Okay.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.120
All right.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.120
And then you go to 2021.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.120
Well, 2021 almost looks like it's in line.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.680
It dropped quite substantially.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.240
So notice the drop.

12:42.240 --> 12:43.920
We won't talk about 22 for now.

12:43.920 --> 12:47.120
Let's just look at the transition from 21 to 22.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.120
Yep.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.920
Now let's go to COVID in the middle, in the top.

12:49.920 --> 12:50.920
Yep.

12:50.920 --> 12:54.800
You see it's high and then the marginal, the difference is cut in half.

12:54.800 --> 12:58.440
And if you go back and look at all cause, that marginal difference, when you take a line

12:58.440 --> 13:03.440
and you draw a line from the normal 2015 through 19, you see that that difference, that big

13:03.440 --> 13:05.440
2020 is, the difference is cut in half.

13:05.440 --> 13:08.840
And then you go to the far right and you've got pneumonia.

13:08.840 --> 13:12.040
Pneumonia correlates with COVID, correlates with all cause.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.040
It goes down.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.760
The marginal difference is cut in half, COVID is cut in half.

13:15.760 --> 13:19.320
Everything is cut in half for those causes of death and all cause.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.800
Now let's look at what happened in the blood and circulatory deaths.

13:22.800 --> 13:23.800
Okay.

13:23.800 --> 13:24.800
Okay.

13:24.800 --> 13:25.800
Yep.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.360
So when I say blood, what that is, those are decodes.

13:27.360 --> 13:32.440
Those are ICD-10 codes from international, you know, they come from the WHO.

13:32.440 --> 13:35.280
Every ailment on the planet has a code.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.520
And so if you're dying from it or whatever, it gets that code.

13:38.520 --> 13:39.520
Right.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.520
That's how they track it, sort of in computer systems.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.520
Right.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.680
That doesn't mean the codes are right, but, you know, ketrasparibus or ceterisparibus,

13:45.680 --> 13:49.280
as people say, all the other things being equal, we're looking at a set of data where

13:49.280 --> 13:52.040
the same people are there coding, so nothing else has changed.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.040
Right.

13:53.040 --> 13:57.920
So in that blood in the bottom left, you'll see that it went up from 2020 to 2021.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.920
Okay.

13:58.920 --> 14:02.840
Those are decodes, anything starting with D. Then you have cardiac arrest.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.280
That's a really big one.

14:04.280 --> 14:09.560
I won't get into a discussion of that, but that's a mistake in the way codes are written

14:09.560 --> 14:14.040
by the WHO, the whole ICD-10 code.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.920
They're listed as heart-related issues.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.400
All that means is the heart stopped.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.400
Right.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.400
Nothing wrong with the heart.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.480
The heart stopped because it didn't get oxygen because the person had pneumonia and

14:22.480 --> 14:24.240
went anoxic and they died.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.240
Okay.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.920
But they write cardiopulmonary arrest, which goes under an I-4, and now I'm getting into

14:28.920 --> 14:29.920
something different.

14:29.920 --> 14:30.920
Okay.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.920
Let's just say, like, let's keep it on the surface.

14:32.920 --> 14:33.920
Yeah.

14:33.920 --> 14:34.920
Well, they can get your information.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.720
We'll make sure that they get that.

14:36.720 --> 14:40.640
So it went up from 2020 to 2021, all right.

14:40.640 --> 14:44.000
And then cardiac arrhythmia also went up from 2020 to 2021.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.200
Now when all causes went down, COVID went down, pneumonia went down, the blood and circulatory

14:48.200 --> 14:49.200
went up.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.200
How does that make any sense?

14:50.200 --> 14:51.200
Right.

14:51.200 --> 14:55.360
Because something else came in 21 that was not COVID that killed people.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.360
Right.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.360
Okay.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.360
All right.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.360
So then what does that take us?

14:59.360 --> 15:00.360
What's the next step?

15:00.360 --> 15:01.360
So what do you look at next?

15:01.360 --> 15:02.360
Let's bring up the next graph.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.960
This lies that you sent us that we can proceed.

15:03.960 --> 15:04.960
Okay.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.480
Let's go through the individuals and then I'll get back to people.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.480
All right.

15:07.480 --> 15:08.480
Okay.

15:08.480 --> 15:12.160
So what you have here is this is acute post hemorrhagic anemia.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.480
You can see that 2020, there was no excess.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.480
Right.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.640
The third from the right, there's no excess.

15:17.640 --> 15:18.640
Right.

15:18.640 --> 15:22.160
All of a sudden in 21 and 22, now what is acute post hemorrhagic anemia?

15:22.160 --> 15:23.400
It's sudden blood loss anemia.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.400
Okay.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.400
You had sudden blood loss.

15:25.400 --> 15:26.640
I looked through them.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.640
More than 89% said non-traumatic.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.640
What that means is-

15:29.640 --> 15:34.680
If I'm in a car accident, I sever an arm, I die of blood loss, but this is non-traumatic.

15:34.680 --> 15:35.680
It's non-traumatic.

15:35.680 --> 15:36.680
That did not happen.

15:36.680 --> 15:39.360
There wasn't an oops in the operating room.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.920
All of a sudden you started bleeding out in your body somewhere.

15:41.920 --> 15:48.440
A lot of them what I found is gastrointestinal hemorrhages have been up, aortic dissection.

15:48.440 --> 15:51.960
It eats a hole in your aorta and you just bleed out through your aorta.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.840
So those were up substantially as you could see from that graph.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.240
I mean, 21 and 22, but not in 2020.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.240
Wow.

15:58.240 --> 16:03.760
It looks like almost 100% gain in 22 and in 23, you know, it's probably still up.

16:03.760 --> 16:04.760
Wow.

16:04.760 --> 16:05.760
Amazing.

16:05.760 --> 16:06.760
Right next we're looking at-

16:06.760 --> 16:07.760
Okay.

16:07.760 --> 16:08.760
Okay.

16:08.760 --> 16:09.760
We'll go to cancers now.

16:09.760 --> 16:10.760
Okay.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.960
There's a lot of talk about turbo cancer.

16:12.960 --> 16:13.960
Yeah.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.120
People say there's no signal.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.440
Well, there is.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.440
Okay.

16:17.440 --> 16:22.880
Because I found that everything that went high was associated with blood and circulatory,

16:22.880 --> 16:24.800
where would you expect cancers to start?

16:24.800 --> 16:29.880
Well, the blood is made by the white cells, your lymph and red, white and platelets made

16:29.880 --> 16:30.880
by bone marrow.

16:30.880 --> 16:31.880
Right.

16:31.880 --> 16:32.880
Exactly.

16:32.880 --> 16:33.880
I don't have the bone marrow slide here.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.080
We only have so many slides we just put up.

16:36.080 --> 16:40.480
But if you looked at the lymph node cancer in Massachusetts, more than 400% of normal

16:40.480 --> 16:41.480
in 2023.

16:41.480 --> 16:42.480
Wow.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.880
258% of normal in 2022.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.280
And it's still going up.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.280
It's still going up.

16:47.280 --> 16:51.920
It's not an acute problem like the sudden blood loss anemia or cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac

16:51.920 --> 16:54.520
arrest, pulmonary embolism.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.600
Those happen pretty soon after.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.600
Now they're happening.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.080
The more people take boosters.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.080
Right.

17:00.080 --> 17:03.200
Well, what we're talking about now are the reasons why I keep screaming for long-term

17:03.200 --> 17:04.200
safety trials.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.200
Exactly.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.200
Right.

17:06.200 --> 17:11.240
I mean, there's the issues that happen within, you know, a short period of time after vaccination

17:11.240 --> 17:12.800
or any drug.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.040
But what is like the downstream effects?

17:15.040 --> 17:19.200
What, you know, what are the cancer rates and things that take years to develop?

17:19.200 --> 17:20.200
Absolutely right.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.280
And those cancer rates are extremely high.

17:22.280 --> 17:25.320
And they're moving toward other cancers, not just blood-related cancers.

17:25.320 --> 17:26.320
Okay.

17:26.320 --> 17:27.320
And that a pleietic.

17:27.320 --> 17:28.320
The numbers are low.

17:28.320 --> 17:29.320
Have that chart.

17:29.320 --> 17:30.320
Yep.

17:30.320 --> 17:31.320
There it is.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.320
Oh, there it is.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.320
Yeah.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.320
Look at that.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.320
The numbers are low.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.320
This is Minnesota.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.320
Right.

17:37.320 --> 17:38.320
Yep.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.320
That's Minnesota.

17:39.320 --> 17:40.320
I also have 420,000 death certificates from Minnesota.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.520
And if they do a good job and really look in the autopsy, they do the microscope work.

17:42.520 --> 17:46.840
They do the blood analysis, blood labs, tissue samples, then they will find things like

17:46.840 --> 17:47.840
this.

17:47.840 --> 17:48.840
But if they're lazy, they won't.

17:48.840 --> 17:53.200
Each jurisdiction, how good their death certificates are, depends on the culture within the office

17:53.200 --> 17:54.200
in that area.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.200
Got it.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.200
Yeah.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.200
Okay.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.200
So you saw how much that's going on.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.200
Right.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.200
All right.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.200
Next.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.200
I mean, this is super fascinating.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.200
And, you know, we don't get an opportunity because this data is so hard to get to it.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.800
CDC should be printing this out on a daily basis.

18:06.800 --> 18:07.800
Absolutely.

18:07.800 --> 18:08.800
They have the ability.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.800
We're supposed to be one of the most transparent nations in the world.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.360
We're supposed to have the highest levels.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.880
I always say this, you know.

18:13.880 --> 18:14.880
We're the home of Google.

18:14.880 --> 18:15.880
We're the home of Apple.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.960
We're the home of Microsoft.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.480
We have computer learning.

18:19.480 --> 18:23.080
We should be able to just show the world exactly everything that's going on.

18:23.080 --> 18:26.040
And we have some of the worst data collection in the world.

18:26.040 --> 18:29.120
We're less transparent than in some cases than China.

18:29.120 --> 18:34.760
I mean, it's really outrageous how much work it takes to get to this information that you're

18:34.760 --> 18:36.840
sharing with our audience right now.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.320
We didn't talk about this ahead of time.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.320
Yeah.

18:39.320 --> 18:40.920
Let me interject that this is the time to do it.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.600
The government has all this data.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.840
I'm one guy with a home computer.

18:44.840 --> 18:45.840
Right.

18:45.840 --> 18:46.840
And I put together a system.

18:46.840 --> 18:50.320
What only can the system show you the individual causes of death, which I've been doing?

18:50.320 --> 18:56.040
I can traverse the hierarchy from all cause down to causes and ages down to the individual.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.760
And we can go investigate the individuals and what they died from.

18:58.760 --> 19:03.400
So when it says on a death certificate that they died with the vaccine hours earlier,

19:03.400 --> 19:08.120
okay, or a day or two earlier, and I see that the cause is cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac

19:08.120 --> 19:10.040
arrhythmia and cardiac arrhythmia over and over again.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.360
And then I go look at the aggregated data.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.600
Cardiac arrhythmia is high.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.760
Well, yeah, I can assume that all those excess.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.080
This is the tragedy, right?

19:19.080 --> 19:24.240
You know, Joe Biden stood in front of us and said, I'm going to spend $10 billion promoting

19:24.240 --> 19:29.280
this vaccine, this experimental product in media, basically just spend it on television

19:29.280 --> 19:30.800
telling you to get it.

19:30.800 --> 19:36.520
You know, clearly we didn't spend $10 billion on tracking it and putting every scientist

19:36.520 --> 19:37.520
we know.

19:37.520 --> 19:40.920
In fact, no science would be being done if you weren't grabbing the data yourself, or

19:40.920 --> 19:45.200
as I've pointed out, what we do with ICANN is get a hold of data and then share it with

19:45.200 --> 19:49.280
all the scientists in the world so that they can actually see what's going on there

19:49.280 --> 19:52.000
because we can't afford to do as much science as it would be.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.520
All I can do is say, hey, if you're at a university, if you have the ability to calculate this,

19:56.520 --> 19:57.520
take it.

19:57.520 --> 19:58.520
Here's the data.

19:58.520 --> 19:59.680
We need information here.

19:59.680 --> 20:05.880
So we're basically open sourcing this data, but this is what our regulatory agencies are

20:05.880 --> 20:07.520
paid to do, and they don't do it.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.640
They're purposely not doing it, and I prove it.

20:09.640 --> 20:15.120
In the CDC memorandum, which is a second publication I have, the real CDC is my book that's

20:15.120 --> 20:16.120
coming out.

20:16.120 --> 20:21.360
Then the CDC memorandum is 172 enumerated paragraphs of factual allegations, and it goes through

20:21.360 --> 20:26.320
how they have purposely not looked at it, and they're recklessly endangering the public,

20:26.320 --> 20:29.120
and I give them legal notice that now they have the information.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.680
But let me get back to the data.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.120
The data belongs to the public, and they're hiding it and obfuscating it from us.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.560
Now, I have a bill in New Hampshire, 1661.

20:37.560 --> 20:41.840
What that does is it puts a structure around reporting the public health data in the manner

20:41.840 --> 20:45.840
in which I already did, but with better access with somebody going inside to look

20:45.840 --> 20:51.800
at that data, report it back to the public, and the oversight committee or the budget

20:51.800 --> 20:57.200
committee, they have to do an analysis of how that bill might impact the state finances.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.440
Just read that less than half an hour ago in the booth up there.

21:00.440 --> 21:07.280
It's only like 160 grand a year to save people from dying, like a lot of people, and to show

21:07.280 --> 21:08.800
the public health.

21:08.800 --> 21:13.720
What I've done is put together a system, which is not AI, but it's intelligent, and

21:13.720 --> 21:17.320
it looks at the past history, and currently, what's going on.

21:17.320 --> 21:21.720
It can be used as an early warning system as to how people are dying before they even

21:21.720 --> 21:24.560
know there's any kind of virus, before they know there's something wrong with the water

21:24.560 --> 21:26.880
supply in three zip codes somewhere.

21:26.880 --> 21:30.160
I'll find it in the data, and they have this data.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.160
They should be doing this.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.720
That's their purview, but they're not doing it.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.200
I mean, it's really amazing.

21:34.200 --> 21:40.600
We reported over the last several weeks, there's this massive rise in excess mortality last

21:40.600 --> 21:51.400
year, 2023, nearly, I think, over 150,000 excess deaths compared to the 2015-2019 average,

21:51.400 --> 21:52.400
just skyrocketing.

21:52.400 --> 21:59.160
I say it's like three Vietnam's, and yet, no one at CNN is even really asking a question

21:59.160 --> 22:00.160
about it.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.080
One report at Fox.

22:02.080 --> 22:08.720
This would be the opening of any dystopian nightmare future scenario where scientists

22:08.720 --> 22:15.080
are screaming, we don't know why, but in every nation in the world, excess mortality is tenfold,

22:15.080 --> 22:20.240
and yet, it's just people like you that are doing anything about it or looking into it.

22:20.240 --> 22:25.760
That's why it's going to stand around my words here.

22:25.760 --> 22:31.440
Organizations like yours are just that important, because the Pfizer commercials and the Moderna

22:31.440 --> 22:35.320
commercials and everything going through Fox or CNN, I probably shouldn't name anything

22:35.320 --> 22:41.640
here yet, but the big, normal, regular media, they're going down in flames.

22:41.640 --> 22:43.200
Nobody can trust them anymore.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.080
They killed a million Americans.

22:45.080 --> 22:48.080
The protocols killed a million Americans, remdesivir.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.760
I don't know if we can bring it up.

22:49.760 --> 22:53.040
Let's continue back to the data for those that are watching.

22:53.040 --> 22:59.640
You're not going to see this really anywhere else on television, so intracranial, okay?

22:59.640 --> 23:06.680
So I'll say the name Eden was 17 years old, and she's in that number four, which is third

23:06.680 --> 23:07.680
from the right.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.080
She's only in that number four.

23:09.080 --> 23:13.880
She died from a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis type hemorrhagic stroke.

23:13.880 --> 23:18.360
I'll go through the particulars of that in a minute, but you see that G08 is where that

23:18.360 --> 23:26.080
gets coded under intracranial and intraspinal phlebitis and thrombophlebitis.

23:26.080 --> 23:30.560
But we have to remember, even when we see four, ten, seven, I guess you could, if you're

23:30.560 --> 23:36.320
crazy, you're like, well, I mean, that's a small number of people to get killed by vaccination.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.960
But each one of these is just one code, right?

23:38.960 --> 23:44.280
We're talking about you start stacking these all together, and you have a massive crisis,

23:44.280 --> 23:51.600
and one of the things that's amazing about this vaccine is just how many different ways

23:51.600 --> 23:52.600
it can kill.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.960
Because it's the blood, and the blood goes all over your body.

23:54.960 --> 23:55.960
Fantastic.

23:55.960 --> 23:56.960
No.

23:56.960 --> 23:57.960
It sounds like there's so many ways, right?

23:57.960 --> 23:58.960
Yeah.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.440
Because that's what it ends up being.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.680
But what it starts as, it's all about the blood.

24:02.680 --> 24:03.680
Right.

24:03.680 --> 24:04.680
Your blood's messed up.

24:04.680 --> 24:05.680
The blood is dysregulated.

24:05.680 --> 24:06.680
Yeah.

24:06.680 --> 24:10.080
The white cells, red cells, platelets, all three of them have problems right now.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.080
Wow.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.080
But I'm not a doctor.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.080
I won't go there.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.080
We can just talk about that.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.080
Okay.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.080
Let's continue on.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.080
All right.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.080
Pulmonary embolism.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.080
Okay.

24:19.080 --> 24:23.000
This alone, more than 500 excess deaths in Massachusetts alone in 21 and 22.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Wow.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.320
Maybe that it looks like 20 is up, but 20 is only up because there were 8,800 excess deaths

24:29.320 --> 24:33.680
in nine weeks, which drove the numbers of other things, and many old people die with

24:33.680 --> 24:38.440
a clot in their lungs because they weren't taken care of, or whatever hospital protocols

24:38.440 --> 24:43.520
or you could call a COVID if you want if you want to do that.

24:43.520 --> 24:48.160
But the point is, but once it's passed, don't forget that first graph.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.160
COVID went down.

24:49.160 --> 24:50.160
All cause went down.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.920
pneumonia went down.

24:51.920 --> 24:52.920
This is skyrocketed.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.840
Up from 20 to 21, it went up.

24:55.840 --> 25:00.000
So 500 excess deaths in Massachusetts alone, pulmonary embolism.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
It's a big one.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
That's a big one.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Right next.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Cute renal failure.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
There it is.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Wow.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Now this is Massachusetts.

25:07.000 --> 25:14.040
It's up over 100%, but the numbers and I'm very conservative with my estimates of trending.

25:14.040 --> 25:18.160
So if it's a positive slope, I use the positive slope, if it's a negative slope, I don't

25:18.160 --> 25:19.160
even use the negative slope.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.880
I use a flat line average.

25:21.880 --> 25:26.120
People with math will understand that, but I'm very conservative in my estimate of excess

25:26.120 --> 25:27.120
deaths.

25:27.120 --> 25:31.040
It's actually more than what I'm telling you, but what I'm telling you is this 2,000

25:31.040 --> 25:36.160
excess deaths in Massachusetts alone by acute renal failure.

25:36.160 --> 25:40.960
This extrapolated across the country is 100,000 people excess, more than normal, died from

25:40.960 --> 25:45.360
acute renal failure in 21 and 22, doesn't even count 23.

25:45.360 --> 25:49.800
Now this is so big, you would say that as a single cause of death, it's bigger than

25:49.800 --> 25:53.520
anything since the Spanish flu, 1918 and 19, 19, 19.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.800
Why is our government not even talking about it?

25:55.800 --> 25:58.920
This is massive and it's not just old people.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.960
This goes down into the 16 to 24 year olds.

26:01.960 --> 26:02.960
It goes through all the age.

26:02.960 --> 26:06.520
One of the things that you talked about, we decided to skip it because it's complex to

26:06.520 --> 26:12.440
look at the grass, but it's this swing in the average age of death year to year, usually

26:12.440 --> 26:16.760
this is something that just barely moves and when you look at your grass, they're going

26:16.760 --> 26:17.760
to be younger.

26:17.760 --> 26:22.440
It's something is just yanking these things in really abnormal directions.

26:22.440 --> 26:27.720
As they go younger, you're talking about multiplying the number of life years lost per

26:27.720 --> 26:28.720
death.

26:28.720 --> 26:33.320
So if somebody dies at 2 years old that otherwise would have lived 80, they lost 78 years.

26:33.320 --> 26:36.040
If an 80 year old dies, they lost one year.

26:36.040 --> 26:41.920
So that one child that died is worth 80 old people, because that's the difference in life

26:41.920 --> 26:45.400
years lost is huge and people are dying younger.

26:45.400 --> 26:49.720
I want to look at one of these individuals just to show how you're doing this, to show

26:49.720 --> 26:53.640
like the data, because you don't get all the information there, right?

26:53.640 --> 26:55.680
These are just bars.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.440
We care about people, right?

26:57.440 --> 27:00.520
So let's bring up, pick any one, Eden.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.520
Here we go.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.520
Here's Eden.

27:02.520 --> 27:03.520
You're talking about.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.520
What am I looking at here?

27:04.520 --> 27:07.200
This is a VAERS record right here or this is the...

27:07.200 --> 27:08.600
This is a VAERS record.

27:08.600 --> 27:12.800
What I do is I create templates that extract the information from a spreadsheet.

27:12.800 --> 27:17.200
The spreadsheet is from the official government VAERS records.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.960
It has the VAERS ID.

27:18.960 --> 27:19.960
Anybody can check it.

27:19.960 --> 27:21.480
Female, 17 years old.

27:21.480 --> 27:26.320
It has her injection date of May 23rd.

27:26.320 --> 27:31.360
And then the report date is important at 610, June 10th.

27:31.360 --> 27:39.360
What it says there is she had massive brain swelling in farksions, and you could probably

27:39.360 --> 27:40.360
read it better than I thought.

27:40.360 --> 27:45.000
The massive brain swelling in farksions, decompressive craniectomy.

27:45.000 --> 27:50.240
Unable to control intracranial pressure, parents agreed to DNR status, do not resuscitate

27:50.240 --> 27:53.680
and patient is not expected to survive.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.160
Now, that was...

27:55.160 --> 27:56.720
Now, read the orange in the bottom.

27:56.720 --> 28:00.600
So then the orange says, headaches started around three weeks prior to the event, that

28:00.600 --> 28:03.240
delayed dose of the second vaccine.

28:03.240 --> 28:08.040
Headache was very severe, and she saw a PCP for it twice, and it lasted a week.

28:08.040 --> 28:12.680
It then resolved, and oh my gosh, she got her second vaccine.

28:12.680 --> 28:14.120
Now we can go to her death certificate.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.640
And then we go to her death certificate.

28:15.640 --> 28:17.440
So that's the VAERS report that was filed.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.080
The VAERS report doesn't have a name.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.080
Okay.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.080
There's no name on the VAERS report.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.080
Right, okay.

28:22.080 --> 28:26.680
So what I'm doing here is scouring the VAERS records and scouring the death certificate

28:26.680 --> 28:27.880
gets to find matches.

28:27.880 --> 28:28.880
Okay.

28:28.880 --> 28:34.160
And so your death certificate you received has a name with a little less information in

28:34.160 --> 28:35.880
it than the VAERS report would have.

28:35.880 --> 28:36.880
Correct.

28:36.880 --> 28:43.080
And it just says, complications of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, unknown.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.720
Massive stroke.

28:44.720 --> 28:45.720
And you know...

28:45.720 --> 28:50.240
The unknown is the time from beginning to death.

28:50.240 --> 28:51.240
Okay.

28:51.240 --> 28:52.240
That's...

28:52.240 --> 28:54.960
It would say like five days or months or years or whatever.

28:54.960 --> 28:55.960
So they're just...

28:55.960 --> 28:56.960
So how do you do it?

28:56.960 --> 28:57.960
You get this.

28:57.960 --> 28:59.280
It has a little bit of information.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.280
You have dates.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.280
You have the state.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.280
You have the name.

29:02.280 --> 29:03.280
So...

29:03.280 --> 29:05.520
Then you go to the VAERS system, which we just saw.

29:05.520 --> 29:08.120
And I'm going to assume you look for that date, right?

29:08.120 --> 29:11.840
Like, do I line up the dates of where this event took place?

29:11.840 --> 29:13.920
Female, 17 years old.

29:13.920 --> 29:14.920
Okay.

29:14.920 --> 29:15.920
Okay.

29:15.920 --> 29:16.920
And I look for stroke symptoms.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.000
All right.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.040
If you saw the death certificate, that was one day after that VAERS report.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.360
They said not expected to survive.

29:23.360 --> 29:24.360
Right.

29:24.360 --> 29:28.080
She got two shots, had headaches, went to the doctor twice.

29:28.080 --> 29:29.080
It resolved.

29:29.080 --> 29:30.080
She got her second shot.

29:30.080 --> 29:33.200
The shot date is 523 May 23rd.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.160
The report date was June 10th.

29:35.160 --> 29:38.120
The death certificate is June 11th.

29:38.120 --> 29:41.920
And when you look for a female, 17 years old...

29:41.920 --> 29:42.920
No others in Massachusetts.

29:42.920 --> 29:43.920
There's none in that time.

29:43.920 --> 29:44.920
There's none in that time.

29:44.920 --> 29:45.920
No.

29:45.920 --> 29:46.920
It's easy.

29:46.920 --> 29:47.920
That's it.

29:47.920 --> 29:48.920
And you put this information...

29:48.920 --> 29:49.920
How many 17 years old?

29:49.920 --> 29:51.080
I can't imagine how time-consuming that is.

29:51.080 --> 29:56.120
And I can't imagine how easy it would be for the CDC or the NIH to do this since they're

29:56.120 --> 29:57.480
staring at all the data.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.320
Oh, they have the Immunization Information System.

29:59.320 --> 30:00.320
Right.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.120
And I think the state has their own Immunization Information System.

30:03.120 --> 30:07.720
And what I propose to Latipo and DeSantis more than a year and a half ago is that I come

30:07.720 --> 30:10.480
down, just give me a week in an office, won't cost you anything.

30:10.480 --> 30:11.480
I'll do it pro bono.

30:11.480 --> 30:16.280
I'll even get somebody to pay for my flight and I will correlate the death certificate

30:16.280 --> 30:19.160
database with the Immunization Records and it'll be over.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.560
This whole thing can end.

30:20.560 --> 30:21.920
There's no debate.

30:21.920 --> 30:22.920
Just let us see the data.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.720
But the government is hiding the data from us.

30:24.720 --> 30:25.760
They won't let us see it.

30:25.760 --> 30:28.360
And it's purposeful that they're not looking at it.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.480
Because if they looked at it, they know.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.320
We'll find tens of thousands.

30:32.320 --> 30:36.520
As I said, I think it might have been the last show, when you go to the CDC, what you

30:36.520 --> 30:41.240
see now is just a bunch of butts in the air and every scientist has got their head into

30:41.240 --> 30:45.920
the dirt because it'd be so easy to be able to figure out what's going on here.

30:45.920 --> 30:53.560
And I say this, when they don't look at it and they refuse to look at it, when, look,

30:53.560 --> 30:58.840
we can't say it's definitively this, there can be several things on the table.

30:58.840 --> 31:01.360
But why is this the only thing not on the table?

31:01.360 --> 31:02.360
Why is vaccination?

31:02.360 --> 31:04.880
When you're seeing it rise in excess death.

31:04.880 --> 31:08.640
And I always say, when you have food poisoning, what's the first thing you do?

31:08.640 --> 31:10.920
You ask yourself, what did I eat last night?

31:10.920 --> 31:16.280
When you suddenly have people dying at rates that can't be explained by a virus that's

31:16.280 --> 31:20.760
circulating, you got to ask yourself, what did we do differently across every single

31:20.760 --> 31:21.760
state?

31:21.760 --> 31:26.240
In this case, across every nation that we're all seeing, we're all seeing something that

31:26.240 --> 31:33.160
is unprecedented worldwide, all seeing the rates of myocarditis and cancers.

31:33.160 --> 31:38.040
And as you've shown out, rising, then you've got to look at what did we do differently?

31:38.040 --> 31:42.520
We gave you all this experimental product that we didn't know what the side effects

31:42.520 --> 31:43.520
would be.

31:43.520 --> 31:46.600
We did no long term studies on it, so it has to be on the table.

31:46.600 --> 31:52.120
And if you were going out of your way to keep it off the table, that tells me, you

31:52.120 --> 31:54.560
know what's going to happen as soon as you put it on the table.

31:54.560 --> 31:55.560
It's not that you don't know.

31:55.560 --> 31:57.840
You know exactly what we're all going to find.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.080
I can't see it in the other way.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.920
I know I'm going to study human nature my whole life.

32:01.920 --> 32:06.280
If you know for a fact, if I throw this on the table, it's going to be exonerated right

32:06.280 --> 32:07.280
away.

32:07.280 --> 32:08.720
It'd be the first thing that you do.

32:08.720 --> 32:12.880
The word no that you kept using there, that's the important part, okay?

32:12.880 --> 32:17.480
In order to prove somebody is guilty of a crime, the men's ray needs to be proven.

32:17.480 --> 32:21.200
So purposeful, knowing reckless, negligent needs to be proven somehow.

32:21.200 --> 32:27.080
The CDC memorandum has the 172 facts enumerated, and then it goes through a legal analysis

32:27.080 --> 32:30.480
of uttering, which is a subset of fraud, if you will.

32:30.480 --> 32:33.720
And it has involuntary manslaughter, depraved heart murder, and felony murder.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.920
I go through the analysis of the facts.

32:35.920 --> 32:41.200
And once the document is served to the FDA, CDC, NIH directors, 12 of their subordinates,

32:41.200 --> 32:44.140
and then I'll copy six state attorneys general in the hopes that they'll empanal

32:44.140 --> 32:45.880
grand juries to investigate this.

32:45.880 --> 32:50.520
But once those directors are given knowledge, okay, they have, they know, they have a legal

32:50.520 --> 32:51.520
duty to act.

32:51.520 --> 32:55.000
You and I don't have that legal duty, we didn't take that job, they took that job.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.360
It's like a crossing guard not telling Johnny to not step out in the street.

32:58.360 --> 33:02.080
In fact, it's worse, it's like the crossing guard saying, Johnny, look at me, here comes

33:02.080 --> 33:03.080
a bus.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.080
Okay, Johnny, you ready?

33:04.080 --> 33:05.080
Go.

33:05.080 --> 33:08.560
Jump in, you know, don't look for the bus, look at me, then go.

33:08.560 --> 33:11.000
They have a legal duty to protect the public.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.280
Not only are they're shirking their legal duty, but they're purposely not doing it so

33:15.280 --> 33:18.520
that they protect the vaccine and not the public, that's murder.

33:18.520 --> 33:20.720
And I can prove it in a court of law.

33:20.720 --> 33:23.960
Some of this data is showing things like, I want to go back to the renal failure because

33:23.960 --> 33:28.440
you know, one, a lot of the, you know, the issues you're showing, whether it's cancer

33:28.440 --> 33:32.400
or blood issues, those are, you know, vaccines driven.

33:32.400 --> 33:36.280
But renal failure, is that, is this what we're seeing, the spike in renal failure?

33:36.280 --> 33:38.280
Is that, do you think that caused by the vaccine?

33:39.280 --> 33:41.880
The CARES Act is a behavior modification.

33:41.880 --> 33:46.720
They modified the behavior of doctors through incentives or through coercion from either

33:46.720 --> 33:51.120
medical boards or the hospital administrators who were financially incentivized.

33:51.120 --> 33:55.760
The renal failure didn't go up, I have other graphs to show exactly when it goes up.

33:55.760 --> 34:01.240
But it didn't go up as much in the April and May EUAs for room decivir for older people,

34:01.240 --> 34:03.800
and then the October 22nd, 2020 EUA.

34:03.800 --> 34:11.040
You know, when it went up after the November 2nd, CMS.gov, 20% adder, NCTAP, people can

34:11.040 --> 34:12.400
look that up.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.480
When that hit, it went sky high.

34:14.480 --> 34:21.120
This is the moment they add that extra bonus charge onto every medical bill that tags 20%

34:21.120 --> 34:24.880
on any patient that you gave remdesivir, and look what happened, folks.

34:24.880 --> 34:27.120
This is absolutely stunning.

34:27.120 --> 34:31.080
When you see it on a chart like this, you're in 2021, remember, this is when we're told

34:31.080 --> 34:36.000
the virus isn't really deadly, and just as soon as you make that adjustment, you incentivize

34:36.000 --> 34:44.280
every hospital an extra 20% bonus on the charge being given worth tens of thousands of dollars,

34:44.280 --> 34:47.880
you suddenly watch this spike in renal failure that goes through the roof, and it hasn't

34:47.880 --> 34:48.880
come down.

34:48.880 --> 34:49.880
Hundreds of thousands.

34:49.880 --> 34:50.880
Hundreds of thousands.

34:50.880 --> 34:51.880
Not too contradicting, but think about it.

34:51.880 --> 34:52.880
No, not appreciate it.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.720
Sorry, I left the zero out there.

34:54.720 --> 34:59.920
Half a million dollar ICU stay, 20% is a hundred grand, and people are, there are millions.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.680
I have files.

35:01.680 --> 35:05.760
We can't see the accounting, because if we did, I'd have fun with Warner and Mendenhall.

35:05.760 --> 35:10.400
We'd be going with false claims acts all over the place, but they won't let us see the accounting,

35:10.400 --> 35:14.880
but I have the other records as to when they received the remdesivir.

35:14.880 --> 35:15.880
This is a hard one.

35:15.880 --> 35:23.040
Twenty-eight-year-old woman, her mother brings her in because she tested down 87% on a finger

35:23.040 --> 35:24.040
SPO2.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.040
So oxygen level.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.040
Yeah.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.600
By the time she got to the hospital, it was 95.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.880
So what did the doctors do?

35:31.880 --> 35:35.520
They gave her remdesivir right away because she tested positive for COVID.

35:35.520 --> 35:36.520
She had no fever.

35:36.520 --> 35:37.520
She was 97.9.

35:37.520 --> 35:41.080
I have the vital statistics, the vital stats on her.

35:41.080 --> 35:44.560
I have a 6,000-page medical file her mother shared with me.

35:44.560 --> 35:51.240
I think it's going to be okay, but, you know, that there was, her name is Danielle Alvarez.

35:51.240 --> 35:53.680
I'll just say the name.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.840
And Rebecca Charles is her mom.

35:55.840 --> 36:00.760
And I'm trying not to cry right now because I flew to Florida and went to a conference

36:00.760 --> 36:04.960
and just happened to run into to her, Rebecca.

36:04.960 --> 36:08.080
And, you know, it was tough.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.120
She lost her daughter.

36:09.120 --> 36:10.320
She lost her only daughter.

36:10.320 --> 36:11.320
They killed her.

36:11.320 --> 36:15.920
Not only did they do that, they started prepping her for ventilator, for ventilator, Larazapim,

36:15.920 --> 36:20.000
adasolam, propofol, dexmeditomidine, they gave you the whole thing.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.560
They brought them back out of them when you were trying to breathe.

36:21.560 --> 36:22.560
So they can't fight back.

36:22.560 --> 36:23.560
Right.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.480
They give you a muscle paralytic.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.720
So you can't fight back when they're shoving the trach tube now.

36:27.720 --> 36:28.720
Oh my God.

36:28.720 --> 36:33.440
And it goes over and over, this case after case after case, where they murdered people

36:33.440 --> 36:37.840
and it drove the COVID numbers, okay, but that last graph you showed, you don't have

36:37.840 --> 36:38.840
to put it up again.

36:38.840 --> 36:44.200
But I have a different graph where there's zero correlation in Minnesota between COVID

36:44.200 --> 36:50.480
going up and a curino failure not going up, zero correlation until the money kicked in.

36:50.480 --> 36:54.520
When the money kicked in, the graph started swimming together like salmon, just swimming

36:54.520 --> 36:57.840
together, just perfect correlation after that.

36:57.840 --> 37:02.720
So you go to the hospital with COVID, you get put on remdesivir, you die of kidney failure

37:02.720 --> 37:04.840
with COVID on your death certificate.

37:04.840 --> 37:05.840
No correlation in 2020.

37:05.840 --> 37:06.840
Right.

37:06.840 --> 37:07.840
That's the thing I said.

37:07.840 --> 37:08.840
I had the doctor.

37:08.840 --> 37:11.120
I was like, are, you know, regional failures up?

37:11.120 --> 37:12.120
He's like, yeah, they are.

37:12.120 --> 37:13.120
It's really weird.

37:13.120 --> 37:19.080
It's like, does COVID in known in any stretch of your imagination in science cause renal

37:19.080 --> 37:20.080
failures?

37:20.080 --> 37:21.680
Like, no, not that I've read or anything.

37:21.680 --> 37:24.160
I was like, dude, you're killing people.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.000
Here's a big, here's a big thing I want to, I want to mention because I don't know

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
if it's from does.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.680
I did say dude, by the way, because when we were kids, we were each other's dudes.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.440
I don't know if it's from does severe.

37:34.440 --> 37:37.400
I think it might be a combination of vancomycin or amdesivir.

37:37.400 --> 37:38.880
Doctors tell me I'm wrong.

37:38.880 --> 37:40.560
Everybody's vancomycin destroys the kidneys.

37:40.560 --> 37:44.360
If you give it too much, people are getting these massive infections and they end up septic

37:44.360 --> 37:48.040
and they give vancomycin very strong antibiotic.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.040
But here's the problem.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.560
It doesn't matter that I don't know.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.760
It doesn't matter that doctors might be right or wrong.

37:52.760 --> 37:56.800
The problem is what you just said, they're purposely not looking at it.

37:56.800 --> 38:01.200
They're purposely not looking at 100,000 extra deaths in 21 to 22.

38:01.200 --> 38:05.720
I mean, how can you, it's like they're not only not doing their job, they're purposely

38:05.720 --> 38:09.160
not doing the job and they're promoting the thing that's killing people because it's

38:09.160 --> 38:13.000
incentivized and the people who wrote the bill and it's probably the lobbyists, not

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
the legislators.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.280
The lobbyists write the bills, they hand them to the legislators, here's a donation, put

38:17.280 --> 38:21.720
in my bill, bill gets put in, the CARES Act, we're going to take care of people.

38:21.720 --> 38:22.720
No, you're not.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.080
You killed a million people.

38:24.080 --> 38:28.280
With protocols, vaccines, they killed more than a million people with their legislators.

38:28.280 --> 38:29.680
I absolutely agree with it.

38:29.680 --> 38:30.880
That's what we reported here.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.160
We could go through a bunch more graphs.

38:32.160 --> 38:33.920
I just want to talk about one more personal story.

38:33.920 --> 38:37.720
We have a death certificate here that I'd like to bring up because you know, you said

38:37.720 --> 38:40.080
this is sort of an important story to this.

38:40.080 --> 38:43.240
So this is Brianna, 30 years old.

38:43.240 --> 38:45.560
She passed away in a hospital from a massive stroke and seizure.

38:45.560 --> 38:49.600
She recovered easily from COVID-19 back in November of 2020, along with several of her

38:49.600 --> 38:52.480
close friends and family members with no lingering effects.

38:52.480 --> 38:56.200
On March 30th, she was given a single dose of the Moderna vaccine.

38:56.200 --> 39:00.360
She initially complained of mild nausea and vomiting, but quickly developed a severe headache,

39:00.360 --> 39:04.440
prompting her to visit the local ER where she received treatment for a migraine.

39:04.440 --> 39:08.360
She returned to the ER at least one more time after no relief from the headache.

39:08.360 --> 39:12.640
By April 3rd, Saturday, she no longer recognized her sister.

39:12.640 --> 39:15.200
She had dangerously high intracranial pressure.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.920
She suffered a stroke with paralysis of a left side and a seizure.

39:18.920 --> 39:23.720
Multiple lesions were noted on her brain via MRI.

39:23.720 --> 39:29.760
Obviously, I mean, right there had no issue with COVID, but the vaccine, all hell breaks

39:29.760 --> 39:34.000
lose vomiting and within days she's dead.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.320
What was the cause of death that was listed here?

39:36.320 --> 39:40.400
On her death certificate, it did list that the stroke killed her, but the underlying,

39:40.400 --> 39:41.560
here's the death certificate.

39:41.560 --> 39:44.080
You notice what's in pink at the bottom.

39:44.080 --> 39:48.320
The last thing listed in part one is the U-C-O-D underlying cause of death.

39:48.320 --> 39:49.760
That should be the root cause of death.

39:49.760 --> 39:51.160
It's a backwards time order.

39:51.160 --> 39:52.600
They said COVID killed her.

39:52.600 --> 39:53.600
COVID killed her.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.600
They said COVID killed her.

39:54.600 --> 39:58.880
Even though in that entire description, the VAERS report says she did fine with COVID

39:58.880 --> 40:04.920
days after the vaccine and this death certificate, if it was used and did not do an investigation

40:04.920 --> 40:09.600
attaching it to VAERS, you could walk away and say she died of COVID.

40:09.600 --> 40:16.640
Okay, I've spoken to the person who filled out the VAERS report on Earth, a cousin of

40:16.640 --> 40:18.360
the father.

40:18.360 --> 40:19.360
She knows.

40:19.360 --> 40:20.360
She got it right.

40:20.360 --> 40:21.360
Okay.

40:21.360 --> 40:22.360
This is a fact.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.360
I've spoken to the father very recently.

40:23.360 --> 40:28.200
That was a really tough call because I lost my son in 2018 and when I talk to these guys,

40:28.200 --> 40:31.000
it's, I mean, I'm struggling right now.

40:31.000 --> 40:37.000
So he's trying to get the state to take off COVID and put on the vaccine.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.760
They've been stonewalling him for two years.

40:38.760 --> 40:45.000
That date was March 30th, 2021 she got injected to teach at Methuen High School.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
There's an article.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.600
I have the link in my book, Methuen High School Teachers to Get the Vaccine.

40:50.600 --> 40:53.200
Not only that, this is how we know it's her, right?

40:53.200 --> 40:55.680
I've talked to the family member who input that VAERS record.

40:55.680 --> 40:59.160
Why did she put the, input the VAERS record cause the doctors didn't do it?

40:59.160 --> 41:00.160
Wow.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.160
They didn't do it.

41:01.160 --> 41:06.800
Now there's a report written in the neuro hospitalist magazine by six doctors from the Beth Israel

41:06.800 --> 41:11.160
Deaconess Medical Center in Massachusetts and Harvard Medical College.

41:11.160 --> 41:15.840
Those six doctors, the title of the report is Fatal Post COVID mRNA Vaccine Associated

41:15.840 --> 41:17.360
Cerebral Ischemia.

41:17.360 --> 41:20.520
What that means is the vaccine killed her by stroke.

41:20.520 --> 41:21.880
That's what that title means.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.720
Every paragraph says the vaccine killed her by stroke.

41:24.720 --> 41:29.960
One paragraph says, we have several reports of COVID vaccines killing people by stroke.

41:29.960 --> 41:35.560
Another paragraph says, there are a number of reports where CVST is common, cerebral

41:35.560 --> 41:36.880
venous, sinus thrombosis.

41:36.880 --> 41:37.880
Sound familiar?

41:37.880 --> 41:39.200
That's what Eden died from.

41:39.200 --> 41:44.720
She was injected five weeks after Brianna 20 miles away and died from a CVST.

41:44.720 --> 41:45.920
And it's in the report.

41:45.920 --> 41:51.480
And also where thrombocytopenia is frequent, frequent, okay, frequent.

41:51.480 --> 41:53.840
Diane Dubois was 62 years old.

41:53.840 --> 41:58.080
Three weeks before Brianna was injected, Diane died from acute intracranial hemorrhage in

41:58.080 --> 42:00.640
the setting of thrombocytopenia.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.840
Three women, three strokes, chapter two in my book.

42:02.840 --> 42:08.600
And this is part of this whole scam that began in the middle of COVID that we reported

42:08.600 --> 42:13.120
on where doctors were being told basically to misrepresent the death certificate.

42:13.120 --> 42:15.560
You talk about that underlying cause of death.

42:15.560 --> 42:18.480
They started saying the COVID numbers were through the roof.

42:18.480 --> 42:23.880
But really because they were just categorizing everybody that died with COVID as having died

42:23.880 --> 42:24.880
from COVID.

42:24.880 --> 42:26.880
I just want to do a flashback here.

42:26.880 --> 42:34.160
This is actually the interview I did with Scott Jensen from up in Minnesota.

42:34.160 --> 42:38.160
And this is what we were talking about when they changed how doctors are supposed to fill

42:38.160 --> 42:39.640
out a death certificate.

42:39.640 --> 42:43.000
Imagine now we've got to go back and try and figure out what happened here.

42:43.000 --> 42:50.280
And it looks like our own CDC purposefully went out of their way to basically just cloud

42:50.280 --> 42:54.760
the data and corrupt the data so we'd never really get to the bottom of it.

42:54.760 --> 42:55.760
Take a look at this.

42:55.760 --> 43:01.720
We reported several weeks ago that it looks very much like the CDC is asking doctors and

43:01.720 --> 43:06.080
coroners or whoever fills out these forms to bloat the numbers.

43:06.080 --> 43:09.160
Go ahead and take it, make it all COVID-19.

43:09.160 --> 43:14.240
And this was what went on to say, it is important to emphasize that coronavirus disease 2019

43:14.240 --> 43:20.320
or COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease

43:20.320 --> 43:25.640
caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to the death.

43:25.640 --> 43:27.360
It goes on.

43:27.360 --> 43:28.360
This is a question.

43:28.360 --> 43:31.520
If you're not understanding what we're saying, wink, wink, doctor, here's what you need to

43:31.520 --> 43:32.520
know.

43:32.520 --> 43:36.080
What happens if the terms report on the death certificate indicate uncertainty, meaning

43:36.080 --> 43:37.320
I'm uncertain.

43:37.320 --> 43:38.320
What should I do then?

43:38.320 --> 43:45.320
If the death certificate reports terms such as probable COVID-19 or likely COVID-19,

43:45.320 --> 43:50.920
these terms will be assigned the new ICD code, meaning use the code that they did die of

43:50.920 --> 43:51.920
COVID-19.

43:52.080 --> 43:56.000
And in case you're worried, we're going to check up on you, let us just make it clear.

43:56.000 --> 44:01.560
It is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases.

44:01.560 --> 44:03.720
You're a doctor.

44:03.720 --> 44:08.480
What was your experience when you saw this recommendation by the CDC on the death certificates?

44:08.480 --> 44:14.240
Well, that was actually April 3rd, Adele, and I had never seen something like that before.

44:14.240 --> 44:17.640
All of a sudden I read this document from the Department of Health and it said, go ahead

44:17.640 --> 44:19.680
and diagnose COVID-19.

44:19.680 --> 44:21.600
It didn't say put down probable.

44:21.600 --> 44:25.240
It said, go ahead and put it, COVID, you just showed it on your screen before.

44:25.240 --> 44:30.000
And so then I went to the CDC document and that flies completely in the face of the manual

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
that CDC puts out as to how death certificates should be filled up.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.800
In the manual it talks about specificity and precision.

44:35.800 --> 44:39.760
And all of a sudden we're being told, well, if it's reasonable, if it's likely, if it's

44:39.760 --> 44:42.640
probable or it's presumptive, go ahead and put that down.

44:42.640 --> 44:46.880
That was what caused me to raise this up the flagpole if you'll say, hey, I've never been

44:46.880 --> 44:49.800
coached or told before that this is what I need to do.

44:49.800 --> 44:53.720
And so I checked with 50 to 75 positions in Minnesota and none of them could remember

44:53.720 --> 44:54.720
it either.

44:54.720 --> 45:00.640
We didn't have that happen in 2018 when we had 60 to 80,000 deaths from influenza.

45:00.640 --> 45:04.000
If I diagnosed pneumonia and I put that on the death certificate, nobody was telling

45:04.000 --> 45:08.080
me to put influenza on it as well if I happened to be in the middle of a flu epidemic.

45:08.080 --> 45:11.720
If I didn't test for it, if I didn't have an interest in testing for it, then I certainly

45:11.720 --> 45:14.000
shouldn't be putting it on the death certificate.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.600
Typically death certificates are filled out based on causation.

45:16.600 --> 45:19.320
And now we're simply saying, well, you can just correlate it to what happens to be going

45:19.320 --> 45:20.320
your own.

45:20.320 --> 45:22.960
I mean, we never do things like that.

45:22.960 --> 45:28.400
So that was Scott Jensen, who was not only a doctor who'd won, like, doctor of the year

45:28.400 --> 45:30.160
multiple times in Minnesota.

45:30.160 --> 45:34.760
He was a senator and he was reporting to us, they're asking me to manipulate the death

45:34.760 --> 45:38.760
certificate in a way I've never been asked in all my years in medicine.

45:38.760 --> 45:44.200
And now you're stuck trying to filter through, in many ways, contaminated evidence.

45:44.200 --> 45:45.200
Right.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.200
Right.

45:46.200 --> 45:50.280
So that was either alert number two or report number three, both the links are in my book

45:50.280 --> 45:52.360
and in the memorandum.

45:52.360 --> 45:55.040
What that is, is solicitation of fraud.

45:55.040 --> 45:56.040
Okay.

45:56.040 --> 46:03.640
That right there, 18 USC 1035, false statements and healthcare matters, 1040, fraud and disaster

46:03.640 --> 46:06.480
relief, 1343 fraud by wire.

46:06.480 --> 46:07.480
I'll stop now.

46:07.480 --> 46:12.280
But those are multiple federal felonies that they're telling doctors to commit.

46:12.280 --> 46:13.360
And why?

46:13.360 --> 46:15.920
Because the death certificates are controlled by state law.

46:15.920 --> 46:16.920
All right.

46:16.920 --> 46:17.920
That's a federal agency.

46:17.920 --> 46:18.920
Interesting.

46:18.920 --> 46:23.600
Telling the state medical examiners to violate state law.

46:23.600 --> 46:28.640
And then in doing so, that those death certificates then feed up into the CDC of federal agency,

46:28.640 --> 46:34.800
which is why I can then use federal law to say 18 USC 1035, 1040, 1343 and so on.

46:34.800 --> 46:39.760
I have all those analyses in, in partly the book and partly the memorandum.

46:39.760 --> 46:44.280
But what you have here is a Rico criminal organization called the US government in

46:44.280 --> 46:49.560
the CDC FDA NIH, along with the medical boards, FSMB is right there.

46:49.560 --> 46:50.560
Why they exist?

46:50.560 --> 46:51.640
I have no idea.

46:51.640 --> 46:55.120
And then not only the state licensing boards, but the board certifications, the American

46:55.120 --> 46:59.680
board of internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, they all got to go down because

46:59.680 --> 47:02.400
they're all working together against the health of the people.

47:02.400 --> 47:03.400
Yeah.

47:03.400 --> 47:06.760
They're killing, they killed a million Americans in the last couple of years.

47:06.760 --> 47:07.920
It's a Rico scam.

47:07.920 --> 47:10.520
And it's a government against the people, killing the people.

47:10.520 --> 47:11.520
Yeah.

47:11.520 --> 47:12.520
It's really amazing.

47:12.520 --> 47:17.680
No mob boss ever dreamed of something so horrific as what happened here to sort of sum

47:17.680 --> 47:18.680
all of this up.

47:18.680 --> 47:22.840
I think, you know, there's a tragedy a million people have been killed by the decisions

47:22.840 --> 47:27.120
that our government made, the things that they forced, you know, illegal acts as you're

47:27.120 --> 47:28.560
pointing to.

47:28.560 --> 47:33.760
But with COVID, perhaps to me, the greatest tragedy is that this is one of the few viruses

47:33.760 --> 47:36.680
we've ever seen that actually had no effect on children.

47:37.680 --> 47:38.680
Did they catch it?

47:38.680 --> 47:39.680
They spread it.

47:39.680 --> 47:42.120
They have the most serious outcomes when they're young.

47:42.120 --> 47:45.160
In this case, this is a virus that basically left them alone.

47:45.160 --> 47:52.560
The death rate, I think, under 19 is 0.0002 something percent.

47:52.560 --> 47:56.560
So I want to go to this last death certificate in this story because this is a young child

47:56.560 --> 47:57.560
that you have.

47:57.560 --> 48:00.520
And you give this is Cassidy, seven years old.

48:00.520 --> 48:03.120
She spiked a 103 fever.

48:03.120 --> 48:07.760
The severe stomach ache has not had a bowel movement since the day before vaccination,

48:07.760 --> 48:10.440
which makes today three days without one.

48:10.440 --> 48:15.200
First vaccine costs severe nausea and vomiting from five minutes post injection and for the

48:15.200 --> 48:19.360
next eight to 10 hours.

48:19.360 --> 48:22.200
And she's no longer with us.

48:22.200 --> 48:23.200
Yeah.

48:23.200 --> 48:25.080
This is what prompted me to get the death certificates.

48:25.080 --> 48:29.040
I was driving to the gym and I heard on the radio a seven year old died from COVID and

48:29.040 --> 48:31.640
I know from all my work didn't happen.

48:31.640 --> 48:32.640
Right.

48:32.640 --> 48:36.640
The only thing they wrote on her death certificate under causes of death in part one, which is

48:36.640 --> 48:37.640
the causes.

48:37.640 --> 48:42.120
The contributing conditions, there was fungal and bacterial Plurisy, probably from wearing

48:42.120 --> 48:46.880
a mask in school, six hours a day, five days a week, generating all that and rebreathing

48:46.880 --> 48:50.400
your own fungi and stuff.

48:50.400 --> 48:56.360
So the only thing in part one, complications of coronavirus 19 viral infection, they blamed

48:56.360 --> 48:57.360
COVID.

48:57.360 --> 49:03.000
Now, I've asked the state, tell me her vaccination date because I found a seven year old and

49:03.000 --> 49:06.280
I go through the four, there are four different seven year olds who died in Massachusetts around

49:06.280 --> 49:07.280
that time.

49:07.280 --> 49:11.560
I analyze all four in my book and it's up to the people to decide, but there's only one

49:11.560 --> 49:12.560
that matches.

49:12.560 --> 49:13.560
Right.

49:13.560 --> 49:15.240
And in Cassidy is the one that matches.

49:15.240 --> 49:17.000
Why don't they tell the truth?

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
We know she was injected on January 13.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.360
She died on January 18, five days later.

49:22.360 --> 49:26.560
She reacted in the first vaccine, you just read, five minutes and threw up for eight

49:26.560 --> 49:27.560
to 10 hours.

49:27.560 --> 49:30.400
Then they gave her a second one that the report is about.

49:30.400 --> 49:31.400
And then she dies.

49:31.400 --> 49:33.080
I believe it's Cassidy.

49:33.080 --> 49:37.200
I think anybody, any rational person would read that evidence and believe it's Cassidy.

49:37.200 --> 49:42.480
Tell us the truth because all the parents read that, she died of COVID, went out and got

49:42.480 --> 49:46.280
their kids vaccinated for the very thing that killed her.

49:46.280 --> 49:48.560
And the other thing is complications.

49:48.560 --> 49:50.080
There's no other causes in part.

49:50.080 --> 49:53.240
How can you have complications of a death when there's nothing else listed?

49:53.240 --> 49:54.240
It's not pneumonia.

49:54.240 --> 49:57.880
It's not COPA or ARDS, no asthma in part one.

49:57.880 --> 50:00.120
They said she had asthma in part two.

50:00.120 --> 50:01.120
You can't.

50:01.120 --> 50:04.640
And then when I looked because I have the records in every field, 315 different columns

50:04.640 --> 50:10.680
per record, I was able to look and see all the death certificates that that particular

50:10.680 --> 50:15.840
medical examiner wrote and what she wrote and it's complications of, she had the same

50:15.840 --> 50:22.280
phraseology, not a single other medical examiner wrote that in the other 20,000 cases.

50:22.280 --> 50:24.880
Coronavirus-19, viral infection.

50:24.880 --> 50:25.880
That's it.

50:25.880 --> 50:26.880
Yeah.

50:26.880 --> 50:27.880
In days.

50:27.880 --> 50:28.880
You have more complications.

50:28.880 --> 50:29.880
Yeah.

50:29.880 --> 50:30.880
All right.

50:30.880 --> 50:32.320
So I'm sure people want to be able to look at this data.

50:32.320 --> 50:33.320
So what is the best?

50:33.320 --> 50:34.320
Do you have a book?

50:34.320 --> 50:35.320
Yeah.

50:35.320 --> 50:37.880
So the book has a lot of graphs.

50:37.880 --> 50:40.800
You go therealcdc.com.

50:40.800 --> 50:41.960
The realcdc.com.

50:41.960 --> 50:42.960
Yep.

50:42.960 --> 50:45.360
T-H-E-R-E-A-L-S-C-D-C.com.

50:45.360 --> 50:46.360
Okay.

50:46.360 --> 50:47.360
That's the book.

50:47.360 --> 50:48.360
The book is for everybody.

50:48.360 --> 50:49.360
Anybody can understand.

50:49.360 --> 50:54.200
Don't do p-values, statistics, confidence intervals, I do raw data and anybody can look

50:54.200 --> 50:59.320
at a graph and say, oh my God, look at all the people that died of this cause.

50:59.320 --> 51:03.800
The other document, the other publication is called the CDC Memorandum.

51:03.800 --> 51:05.840
That's more difficult for people to read.

51:05.840 --> 51:12.720
It's about 130 pages, it's almost done, 130 pages of text, which 100 pages of factual

51:12.720 --> 51:17.720
allegations and then legal analyses with 157 pages.

51:17.720 --> 51:19.320
Now here's where all the graphs come in.

51:19.320 --> 51:21.560
400 graphs of various causes of death.

51:21.560 --> 51:22.560
Wow.

51:22.560 --> 51:23.560
Do you have a solution?

51:23.560 --> 51:24.560
What's the plan?

51:24.560 --> 51:25.560
What's the goal?

51:25.560 --> 51:28.480
I mean, you're doing all this work, you're staring at it.

51:28.480 --> 51:29.480
What's our way forward?

51:29.480 --> 51:33.560
Where's the light at the end of this very dark tunnel?

51:33.560 --> 51:39.120
You know, I said in early 21, this won't end until everybody knows somebody.

51:39.120 --> 51:46.400
The people I talk to at the hotel desk, the guy who drove me to the hotel from the airport.

51:46.400 --> 51:47.400
Everybody knows somebody now.

51:47.480 --> 51:52.320
We have a rasmus and I think we have that rasmus in article or a poll that was done.

51:52.320 --> 51:57.760
So now that we have something, here we go, a COVID-19 virus deaths versus vaccine deaths.

51:57.760 --> 52:04.040
It gets into the groups that believe someone in their family died of COVID-19.

52:04.040 --> 52:05.760
These numbers are starting to go through the roof.

52:05.760 --> 52:06.760
It's going to get higher.

52:06.760 --> 52:12.320
It adds up to about 25%, 40% are saying that they're pretty sure the vaccine kills people.

52:13.320 --> 52:21.080
So the solution is any state should look at what I've done and either come to me or

52:21.080 --> 52:28.440
I talk to Ed Dowd's guys, Carlos and Yuri, we talk, put together a system to show what

52:28.440 --> 52:31.560
people are dying from and make that information public.

52:31.560 --> 52:36.160
So we need public transparency of health data, that's number one.

52:36.160 --> 52:37.160
What else can we do?

52:37.160 --> 52:38.160
There's a lot involved.

52:38.160 --> 52:39.800
We don't get into politics here.

52:39.800 --> 52:45.640
But you have to have criminal prosecution, otherwise the behavior will not stop.

52:45.640 --> 52:47.520
You can't just slap them on the wrist.

52:47.520 --> 52:51.720
These people murdered people en masse and they knew what they were doing.

52:51.720 --> 52:56.240
And after they get the CDC memorandum that served to them, anybody who subsequently dies

52:56.240 --> 53:00.800
after a reasonable time after receiving it will have done so with knowledge that they

53:00.800 --> 53:04.960
should have investigated and they should have stopped this and have they not, now the men's

53:05.040 --> 53:08.400
right is proven and now you just have to prove causality.

53:08.400 --> 53:09.400
Right.

53:09.400 --> 53:14.640
Well, look, I mean, when we elect our leadership this year's a lot of elections coming up,

53:14.640 --> 53:19.920
I would recommend that we not elect people that sit in there and avoid listening to the

53:19.920 --> 53:24.720
story of children dying and roll their eyes and try to get out of the room, the people

53:24.720 --> 53:28.320
that are paying attention, those are the ones that need to put in the Attorney General's

53:28.320 --> 53:33.200
state by state and the Attorney General's of this nation to actually bring, you know,

53:33.200 --> 53:38.000
I think, you know, criminal indictments against these murderers that, you know, we

53:38.000 --> 53:39.600
need grand jury investigations.

53:39.600 --> 53:41.000
We need grand jury investigations.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.480
Well, your data is going to be a huge part of that.

53:43.480 --> 53:46.240
It's really important that people like you are out there and it's really an honor and

53:46.240 --> 53:48.240
a pleasure to gotten to look through some of your data.

53:48.240 --> 53:49.240
Same here.

53:49.240 --> 53:50.240
Thanks for having me.

53:50.240 --> 53:51.240
All right.

53:51.240 --> 53:52.240
Absolutely.

53:52.240 --> 53:52.260
Thank you.
