WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.180
1213FN and open the public hearing on HB 1661FN and recognize the prime sponsor representative

00:08.180 --> 00:32.180
Gearhart. There he is. And we need a pin card representative. You've got one. Okay. Good. All set. Sure. Thank you. Sure.

00:32.180 --> 00:44.180
Is that Mr. Baldwin or representative Gearhart? Representative Gearhart is you're talking about John Baldwin senior. Yeah. Okay. Great. Thank you.

00:48.180 --> 00:59.180
Good afternoon committee. I'm being joined with John Baldwin. I'm Jason Gerhard Northfield Franklin Merrimack 25.

01:00.180 --> 01:15.180
John Baldwin is a knowledgeable individual on this bill. He helped write most of it. This is a relative to immunization reporting requirements. And this bill requires death certificates to record certain information regarding immunizations received by the descendant.

01:15.180 --> 01:22.180
The bill also established a certain reporting requirements for the Department of Health and Human Services regarding death records and immunizations.

01:23.180 --> 01:38.180
I'd like to hand it off to John for the time being and we'll just switch back and forth. But he has a handout that was passed around that if you'd like to address and take it on. Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:39.180 --> 01:55.180
Thanks for having me guys. Appreciate being here. So this bill is unique in the entire country. What it's doing is allowing the people access to the data that belongs to the people, which is the health of the state.

01:55.180 --> 02:02.180
So I'm just going to start going through the handout a little bit because it'll it'll lend some structure to how you perceive the data.

02:02.180 --> 02:17.180
There was an estimate of $160,000 that was done by New Hampshire with regard to this bill. It doesn't seem as though they looked at the other column where it would save probably more than a million dollars a year for the state.

02:17.180 --> 02:27.180
Can't really talk about that in a short time here. So anybody is welcome to contact me and I can go through any financial analysis and also point out the flaws in the 160 K.

02:28.180 --> 02:45.180
So HB 1661 would be a net budget reduction for the Department of Public Health. It would save lives. That's the most important thing. Save New Hampshire lives and provide a better functioning Department of Public Health and keep them on mission, which is to for the health and the safety of New Hampshire citizens.

02:45.180 --> 02:49.180
Without the bill, the truth remains hidden from the people.

02:50.180 --> 02:55.180
Public confidence in DPH will wane as more people die, which which has been happening.

02:55.180 --> 03:09.180
And people prescribed medicines that were recommended by the government and I don't mean New Hampshire, not necessarily people who rely on the CDC and FDA for what is safe and effective.

03:10.180 --> 03:21.180
They've been let down. Many have been let down. So let's talk about one specific cause. It's it's the code is D 68, but these are other clotting defects.

03:21.180 --> 03:29.180
What you have here on this page, these are New Hampshire residents who died in Massachusetts. I have all the Massachusetts death records.

03:30.180 --> 03:40.180
It would be illegal for me to have New Hampshire records of the same type, but I have these legally from Massachusetts and I've kept this pair of us, all other things being equal.

03:40.180 --> 03:45.180
You see the bar of 2021 being very high when it comes to cloth defects.

03:45.180 --> 03:54.180
And one gentleman Martin from Summersworth, he was 47 years old, died with multi organ failure stroke hyper coagulability. That's hyper clotting.

03:55.180 --> 04:01.180
All of a sudden the guy started hyper clotting all in days. He did not have a history of this.

04:01.180 --> 04:10.180
Cardiac amyloidosis, which is a known condition from COVID gene therapy injections. It's known to happen.

04:10.180 --> 04:17.180
So I don't know when he got his vaccine. This could be correlated and we don't have to let private information out.

04:17.180 --> 04:30.180
What this bill does is it makes sure that the public knows the correlation of the immunizations to the health outcomes, which the people should should know and have a right to know.

04:30.180 --> 04:40.180
With anemia's there is thromasitopenia and ability to clot their leukemia, neutropenia. The example here is febrile neutropenia in hours.

04:41.180 --> 04:48.180
Acute myeloid leukemia AML. That's also a signal that's been growing very strong since COVID immunizations.

04:48.180 --> 04:58.180
And you see that 21 and 22 are also very high for New Hampshire residents who died in Massachusetts hospitals, only again, 21 and 22.

04:58.180 --> 05:05.180
This is sudden kidney failure. It's also called acute renal failure.

05:05.180 --> 05:14.180
This is probably the biggest epidemic of single deaths since 1918-19 and nobody's talking about it. The CDC knows this. They have to know this.

05:14.180 --> 05:22.180
100,000 excess Americans died involving acute renal failure in 21 and 22 and very many in 2023.

05:22.180 --> 05:34.180
And the exact time that it started happening was two weeks after November 2nd, which is CMS.gov, where the NCTAP, which is the incentive, 20% of the entire hospital bill,

05:34.180 --> 05:45.180
gets paid from the federal government, they get a bonus. The hospitals get a bonus. The doctors get a bonus for using remdesivir, barisitinib, and other medicines.

05:45.180 --> 05:57.180
That's a big one. So Joseph was 30 years old, multi-system organ failure in nine days, pneumonia, flu, staphylococcus, aureus, and sudden kidney failure. He was from Franklin, New Hampshire.

05:57.180 --> 06:06.180
Clots in the brain that caused strokes. You see that 2022 is almost double. Actually, it's almost triple some of the other years.

06:06.180 --> 06:17.180
Jeffrey was 53 years old, died from a stroke in days, hypercoagulable in months. Again, very hyper clotting.

06:18.180 --> 06:32.180
Intraventricular hemorrhage. And then Elaine was 61 years old. She died from a cerebral herniation, another kind of stroke, a multifocal cerebral infarcts, and a bonus of an aortic dissection, or aorta blue apart.

06:32.180 --> 06:37.180
Those are also very high since the vaccine, if you want to call it a vaccine.

06:37.180 --> 06:49.180
And lastly, for these, this set is clots in lungs. In Massachusetts, there's more than 500 excess pulmonary embolism deaths in 21 and 22 alone, 500.

06:49.180 --> 06:57.180
And I've correlated many of them with knowledge of their vaccination dates. Now, in New Hampshire, you see that 2021 is very high.

06:58.180 --> 07:10.180
Lindsay was only 27 years old from new to New Hampshire, died August 4th, pulmonary thromboembolie, and deep vein thrombosis. Those are usually in the calf, and they call it throwing a clock, right?

07:10.180 --> 07:24.180
It breaks off, it travels to your lung, and then you can die, and she did. I don't know her vaccination date, but this bill would force that analysis to be done and that analysis is not being done by any government at this time.

07:24.180 --> 07:33.180
That's why it's, it's, you know, purposeful in action, omission of conduct where there's a legal duty to act, and they should be doing this.

07:33.180 --> 07:38.180
So this public oversight in this bill would be the best in the nation.

07:38.180 --> 07:43.180
Also, Jeffrey was 30 years old from Epping, New Hampshire, cardiogenic shock.

07:43.180 --> 07:47.180
It says massive pulmonary embolism in six hours.

07:47.180 --> 07:52.180
He also had brain cancer in eight months, another signal known from the vaccine.

07:52.180 --> 08:04.180
Amy was 40 years old, disseminated in travascular coagulation, all through her body, coagulating class, all through her body, and a pulmonary embolism in DVT.

08:04.180 --> 08:13.180
Now, I do write on, I write a sub stack, probably two or three times a month, so I'm a journalist.

08:13.180 --> 08:21.180
As a journalist and a member of the press, people approach me with information from official sources, and I won't divulge it if I don't think it's real.

08:21.180 --> 08:24.180
But if I check it out, yeah, I will.

08:24.180 --> 08:26.180
So I'm going to share some here today.

08:26.180 --> 08:32.180
This information regarding the health of the people of New Hampshire should not have to have been acquired as I've done.

08:32.180 --> 08:37.180
The data belongs to the people, not the government. The government is of the people.

08:37.180 --> 08:43.180
There are some facts people would have known if Bill 1661 was in place years ago.

08:43.180 --> 08:51.180
At least 87 people, when I say at least, it's because the data have is only a subset of people from New Hampshire, a small subset.

08:51.180 --> 08:55.180
87 people died in New Hampshire within three days of COVID immunization.

08:55.180 --> 09:00.180
At least 50 died within two days of immunization, New Hampshire.

09:00.180 --> 09:05.180
24 died on the day of or the day after immunization.

09:05.180 --> 09:10.180
The next 11 people died on the same day, New Hampshire of immunization.

09:10.180 --> 09:12.180
Rodney Lucas was 62.

09:12.180 --> 09:15.180
Barbara Jenkins, 68, Amy Thomas, 72.

09:15.180 --> 09:18.180
Daniel Cheney was 76.

09:18.180 --> 09:21.180
Ann Kasich, 77.

09:21.180 --> 09:28.180
Louise Fontaine, 81, Marguerite, Temla, 83, Roger Pinchard, 83, Catherine Downs, 84, Sheila Green, 85.

09:28.180 --> 09:33.180
Could you just give the ages and not the names since you have last names there for privacy?

09:33.180 --> 09:34.180
Okay.

09:34.180 --> 09:35.180
Sorry.

09:35.180 --> 09:37.180
I finished actually.

09:38.180 --> 09:41.180
And that is, that is the problem in that.

09:41.180 --> 09:45.180
Do we want to keep secret from the people?

09:45.180 --> 09:48.180
Things that are killing the people.

09:48.180 --> 09:55.180
I mean, the point is the health and safety of the public. And so, you know, they all died on the same day of immunization.

09:55.180 --> 09:58.180
And I'll skip the last name for the, the others.

09:58.180 --> 10:01.180
So, Anna Tucker was 26 years old.

10:01.180 --> 10:05.180
Anna died one day after immunization.

10:05.180 --> 10:09.180
Herobituary says, passed away peacefully in her sleep.

10:09.180 --> 10:13.180
The first name is going to give this guy away.

10:13.180 --> 10:16.180
Stoshu, it's a unique name.

10:16.180 --> 10:22.180
35 years old died on Christmas Eve, two days after immunization unexpectedly.

10:22.180 --> 10:28.180
Robert died March 19, 2022, four days after immunization of matching various report,

10:28.180 --> 10:39.180
22, 01, 082 report, mentions cardiomyopathy because they gave an immunization to a guy with a heart transplant in 2017.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.180
Why would you give somebody a medicine for a heart?

10:41.180 --> 10:42.180
He had a heart transplant.

10:42.180 --> 10:45.180
He also had a bone marrow transplant in 2021.

10:45.180 --> 10:51.180
And if you remember I mentioned AML earlier, he also had acute myeloblastic leukemia.

10:51.180 --> 10:57.180
Now I know from the Massachusetts data and the Minnesota data, I have a million death certificates, unredacted.

10:57.180 --> 11:00.180
Probably the only one on the world outside government.

11:00.180 --> 11:04.180
And if you haven't seen my analyses, I can send you a copy.

11:04.180 --> 11:08.180
I have two books coming out within three weeks.

11:08.180 --> 11:13.180
So, because the government refuses to look at this data and hides the data from the people,

11:13.180 --> 11:17.180
very few of us know that AML is common from this vaccine.

11:18.180 --> 11:19.180
So is a lymphoma.

11:19.180 --> 11:24.180
And all the blood causes on the trifold that I went through a moment ago.

11:24.180 --> 11:27.180
All pretty common from the COVID vaccines.

11:27.180 --> 11:32.180
It's not down party lines, you shouldn't have an orthodoxy one way or the other.

11:32.180 --> 11:33.180
I don't care.

11:33.180 --> 11:37.180
The reason I looked into this is because I lost my son and I wasn't doing anything else and I'm depressed.

11:37.180 --> 11:39.180
And so I just want to save kids.

11:39.180 --> 11:43.180
The adults can take it because do your homework.

11:43.180 --> 11:49.180
If you haven't looked into what this actually is and the defects in manufacturing that Kevin McCurnan found.

11:49.180 --> 11:52.180
And if you don't know what I'm talking about, you should really look into that.

11:52.180 --> 11:58.180
So I don't know how many lawyers are here, but manufacturing defect is a strict liability standard.

11:58.180 --> 11:59.180
Very easy to determine.

11:59.180 --> 12:03.180
They didn't meet their own specifications and they shipped the product anyway.

12:03.180 --> 12:07.180
So the product has DNA contamination in the form of plasmids.

12:07.180 --> 12:10.180
And I'm not a scientist, so I won't go into that in detail.

12:10.180 --> 12:14.180
But the point is they're shipping contaminated product to the public.

12:14.180 --> 12:16.180
And nobody's saying anything.

12:16.180 --> 12:18.180
The government's just saying take it, take it.

12:18.180 --> 12:25.180
So this bill, 1661, I'm just going to close by saying it just gives transparency to the people.

12:25.180 --> 12:27.180
It doesn't matter what side you're on.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.180
If you believe vaccines are safe and effective, great.

12:29.180 --> 12:30.180
This will prove it.

12:30.180 --> 12:32.180
This will prove it.

12:32.180 --> 12:35.180
It'll prove them safe and effective or it'll prove them not safe and effective.

12:35.180 --> 12:38.180
And when I say them, some of them are going to be good.

12:38.180 --> 12:43.180
Some of them are going to be bad because it also has to do with all medicaments, not just vaccines.

12:43.180 --> 12:46.180
So if if remdesivir is good or bad, we'll find out.

12:46.180 --> 12:52.180
If it's a combination of why aren't they looking at remdesivir and combination with Bank of Mison?

12:52.180 --> 12:57.180
That's that's very strong antibiotic given kind of in the end as people go septic.

12:57.180 --> 13:00.180
But I guess I'll just thank you very much for your time.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.180
I hope this impressed something on you.

13:02.180 --> 13:07.180
And if you have any questions, please, please ask me because this is so important.

13:07.180 --> 13:11.180
Representative Gerhard, do you have any thing to add or are you just.

13:11.180 --> 13:14.180
I was just going off at the right. No, I would just.

13:14.180 --> 13:18.180
I was hoping John would talk briefly about the last part, the audits.

13:18.180 --> 13:19.180
I think that's key.

13:19.180 --> 13:22.180
Transparency is the mission here because there's been.

13:22.180 --> 13:26.180
I don't know what the right word would be, but there's been a drop in people getting.

13:26.180 --> 13:30.180
Vaccinations because of fear and concern and so forth.

13:30.180 --> 13:35.180
So the best way to bring back trust is to show the truth and this.

13:35.180 --> 13:38.180
Is part of it. So if you want to speak briefly about that, just explain.

13:38.180 --> 13:39.180
Yeah, sure.

13:39.180 --> 13:40.180
Kind of nature of it.

13:40.180 --> 13:42.180
The section one.

13:42.180 --> 13:50.180
It requires that the vaccine dates immunization any immunizations given within the last two years prior to dying be put on the death certificate.

13:50.180 --> 13:55.180
It's a nominal less than five minute thing that any medical examiner doctor can do.

13:55.180 --> 14:03.180
The analysis of the hundred sixty thousand dollars was was grossly exaggerated because all you really have to do is look for the number of unique names.

14:03.180 --> 14:09.180
In the death certificate database in New Hampshire and only those people would have to be trained.

14:09.180 --> 14:11.180
The only skip to the last.

14:11.180 --> 14:17.180
It also forces the Department of Public Health to do quarterly reports, which would take maybe.

14:17.180 --> 14:19.180
I don't know, fifteen minutes to thirty minutes.

14:19.180 --> 14:29.180
Now when they just put out a quarterly report, it's just you write some scripts and you correlate to databases, the immunization database and the death certificate or Medicare if you want to get complicated.

14:29.180 --> 14:35.180
The last one, though, is really interesting. I like it. Of course, I wrote it.

14:35.180 --> 14:49.180
But it allows the people to come in the state offices and audit the data, not just everybody, but people have to submit reports and of those reports for a drawn by lottery.

14:50.180 --> 14:59.180
And the people doing the work cannot have been in pharma industry, any eco pharma ecosystem company or government.

14:59.180 --> 15:07.180
So it allows for entities, it could be for groups or for individuals or mix to come in and look at the data under NDA.

15:07.180 --> 15:09.180
The data exists for a reason.

15:09.180 --> 15:16.180
It's to be studied and the studying of that data would provide invaluable information to the people with regard to public health.

15:16.180 --> 15:23.180
The reason the public health department exists is for the safety of the public and yet they're not doing anything with it. Nobody is.

15:23.180 --> 15:27.180
So the last part is pretty key.

15:27.180 --> 15:32.180
It allows the people to have access to the data with reports and no one's names.

15:32.180 --> 15:34.180
All privacy laws are adhered to.

15:34.180 --> 15:36.180
There's absolutely no problem.

15:36.180 --> 15:43.180
The only reason to be against this is if somebody's trying to hide something and people on both sides should be for this.

15:44.180 --> 15:45.180
Right. Thank you.

15:45.180 --> 15:46.180
President Obama, you had a question.

15:46.180 --> 15:50.180
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you for taking my question. So.

15:50.180 --> 15:57.180
One clarification. I never got a bonus for taking for prescribing remdesivir. So I missed out on something.

15:57.180 --> 16:00.180
But my concern is.

16:00.180 --> 16:03.180
And my question will follow is.

16:03.180 --> 16:09.180
I was a hospice medical director for about 30 years. So I filled out a lot of debt certificates and I rarely.

16:09.180 --> 16:17.180
Would have had the information on vaccinations because a lot of the times of patient will have shown up at our.

16:17.180 --> 16:18.180
Hospital.

16:18.180 --> 16:23.180
I won't have the records for that and obtaining them would be very difficult.

16:23.180 --> 16:27.180
And I and I still would probably not know, for example, if they got a.

16:27.180 --> 16:34.180
COVID vaccination at a pharmacy, it wouldn't be there. So it would be very hard to collect this data. I wonder if you.

16:34.180 --> 16:42.180
Did any research on that and how that might be made easier because it would be really, I mean, it would, it would take me hours to find that.

16:42.180 --> 16:49.180
Yeah. So in fact, in that analysis of the $160,000, what they're doing is they're talking about how long it would take to train.

16:49.180 --> 16:54.180
Doctors to have access to the new Hampshire immunization information system, which exists.

16:54.180 --> 17:00.180
And that's a registry of all the vaccinations people have gotten if they didn't want it.

17:01.180 --> 17:12.180
There is a box you can check for it to be redacted. And in the case where it's not there, it's not there, but in the case where it is there, it would require a doctor to look it up and that that would be like a less than a five minute thing.

17:12.180 --> 17:26.180
You just go into the NIH, I, I, S. You log in and you'd probably already be logged in if you're doing death certificates. If you're a medical examiner, but if it's a doctor, you're probably talking, you know, if somebody dies in the in the presence of a doctor attending.

17:26.180 --> 17:32.180
That's when a doctor fills out the death certificate. And in that case, it depends. You know, if they work in a care home, they're going to be doing a lot of them.

17:32.180 --> 17:41.180
If they're just, you know, regular family practice and somebody dies, it's probably like once a year, right? So, you know, it might take them 10 minutes instead of five minutes. It's really no big deal.

17:41.180 --> 17:44.180
It's pretty easy to do.

17:44.180 --> 17:47.180
Representative King and then Representative Palazoff.

17:47.180 --> 17:51.180
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for taking questions. I'm a little confused.

17:51.180 --> 18:00.180
What is it about Massachusetts that is different than New Hampshire? You've got some case individuals here and their cause of death.

18:00.180 --> 18:12.180
I guess they put that on their vital, their vital records. They put that on their death certificate. Does New Hampshire not do that? Does New Hampshire not put a cause of death or New Hampshire as a state law that doesn't allow me to have those records.

18:12.180 --> 18:24.180
It's privacy. They're certain. So it's governed by state law. It's not a privacy and death HIPAA violation. That's federal law. And there's the HIPAA doesn't apply to dead people. So each state has privacy.

18:24.180 --> 18:32.180
And many of the states have 50 years. Some have 70 years privacy and death where they wouldn't allow me to have a database of full database of all the decedents.

18:32.180 --> 18:41.180
Massachusetts apparently does allow me to have it in Minnesota as well. And Vermont, we have also, but Vermont does not have the ICD 10 codes from the CDC.

18:41.180 --> 18:49.180
So it's a little different. Follow up. Follow up. So it's not on their death certificates, but the information is available or it is on their death certificates.

18:49.180 --> 18:57.180
New Hampshire has the same death certificates as everybody else. There's part one and part two. Part one has cause ABCD. Part two has conditions contributing.

18:57.180 --> 19:05.180
The causes are in part one and you should not have anything on there that's not causal in the causal chain of events that cause death. However, many of them do it wrong.

19:06.180 --> 19:17.180
Very large number of doctors, no offense, fill out the death certificates improperly. Medical examiners do a better job. It's supposed to be in a reverse time order where cause A is the immediate cause.

19:17.180 --> 19:30.180
And the last one listed in ABC or D, whether it sometimes is only one filled out A, sometimes it goes to D, but the last one is supposed to be the underlying cause of death or root cause, which is the thing that started the causal chain of events that caused the death.

19:30.180 --> 19:35.180
But a lot of them do it in reverse time order backwards. So I hope I answered your question.

19:35.180 --> 19:40.180
Yes, I have one more follow up. Okay.

19:40.180 --> 19:50.180
Would it would it not be beneficial for us to more or less copy what Massachusetts does and at least allowing that information to be accessible like you currently have with Massachusetts.

19:51.180 --> 20:06.180
I mean, that would be good, but that's only the death certificate database. If I were, if I had the Massachusetts data and access to the immunization information registry system, they call it as the MIIS, you have the NHIS in Indiana.

20:06.180 --> 20:11.180
They call it chirp in California. It's cares. It's different acronyms, but they're all the same thing.

20:11.180 --> 20:15.180
Anybody who does that, I will end the entire debate in a week.

20:15.180 --> 20:22.180
Ron DeSantis and Joe Latipo have a proposal for me from a year and a half ago and a year ago, and I told him the invitation is open.

20:22.180 --> 20:29.180
He's been told by six very well known international people, just have him come in for a week or two.

20:29.180 --> 20:34.180
You know, just give me access. All you got to do is correlate the two databases and debate ends.

20:34.180 --> 20:38.180
I'll find over 10,000 people in Florida pretty easily.

20:38.180 --> 20:39.180
Thanks.

20:40.180 --> 20:46.180
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you for taking my question.

20:46.180 --> 20:56.180
I like the idea of transparency and you put here 10 days of close of each fiscal quarter.

20:56.180 --> 21:05.180
So my understanding is some manufacturers, they don't oppose to transparencies.

21:05.180 --> 21:10.180
They only ask for 70 years to be transparent about what's going on.

21:10.180 --> 21:16.180
And my understanding is that New Hampshire is also is not opposed to transparency.

21:16.180 --> 21:26.180
We have DHS visit portal, but it shows mostly data going up to 2019.

21:27.180 --> 21:43.180
So my understanding is that all those deaths and all those spikes like in acute kidney failure and such wouldn't be accessible to public if we are looking only up to 2019.

21:43.180 --> 21:49.180
So my point is like, so it usually takes time.

21:49.180 --> 21:55.180
Sometimes it's for good reason to release data.

21:55.180 --> 21:59.180
So what's a good time?

21:59.180 --> 22:04.180
Like, let's say it's impossible to do it within 10 days.

22:04.180 --> 22:12.180
Like would be like six months be reasonable by one time or five years or 70 years.

22:12.180 --> 22:14.180
Like what's reasonable?

22:14.180 --> 22:15.180
Yeah, I can comment.

22:15.180 --> 22:18.180
So there's there's provisional data that's not been verified.

22:18.180 --> 22:22.180
And that's usually like a year, year and a half, depending on the jurisdiction.

22:22.180 --> 22:34.180
So the federal government, I can't remember that, but it's about six months when they say these deaths, the data that they're providing is provisional saying you can't rely on it.

22:34.180 --> 22:36.180
It's really legal indemnification.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.180
The data is pretty good.

22:39.180 --> 22:49.180
If your public health department is indeed a vigilance, a sentinel standing on the wall looking out for public health, they should be looking at it weekly.

22:49.180 --> 22:54.180
Pathogens come into our society all the time.

22:54.180 --> 22:57.180
I found things in 2018 nobody ever knew about.

22:57.180 --> 23:00.180
There are anomalies in various causes of death.

23:00.180 --> 23:15.180
The system that I've created could potentially, if you put all the data in there and I do all the put all the parameters in, I could tell you, well, 39 years ago, in these two zip codes, there was an increase in B cell lymphocytic leukemia.

23:15.180 --> 23:17.180
Let's go look at their water supply from then.

23:17.180 --> 23:19.180
We have the water reports from then.

23:19.180 --> 23:20.180
Was there too much nickel or cadmium?

23:20.180 --> 23:23.180
This is the type of intelligence that's so easy to do.

23:24.180 --> 23:29.180
The system I've created doesn't exist anywhere in the world and yet the data is available to the government.

23:29.180 --> 23:42.180
I can't answer like a definitive date, but if you have a department of public health whose mission is the health and safety of the public, they should be looking at it weekly.

23:42.180 --> 23:49.180
The reports are rolling in and okay, if it's provisional, that means somebody outside the government looking at it.

23:49.180 --> 23:54.180
It's legal indemnification where you're saying you can't rely on it. We're not responsible if there's a mistake.

23:54.180 --> 23:58.180
All right, that's just semantics.

23:58.180 --> 24:01.180
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

24:01.180 --> 24:07.180
And thank you for all the research that you've done and for coming to share some of your findings.

24:07.180 --> 24:12.180
My first question is around the data that you're looking to get from the IIS.

24:12.180 --> 24:29.180
My question would be just so that we can have good solid data and be able to show which events have no relationship to a vaccination event and to be able to appropriately case match them between those with a vaccination event and those without.

24:29.180 --> 24:41.180
Would you be amenable to having it indicate whether a person has no IIS record because they have not enrolled in the IIS or if they have a record with no vaccination events?

24:41.180 --> 24:51.180
Because those two, it could confound the data if you have somebody who has not chosen to participate in the registry versus those with no vaccine events.

24:51.180 --> 24:59.180
Yeah, absolutely. If they chose not to participate, the record's not there. It's not there. You know, you can't blame.

24:59.180 --> 25:08.180
So if there needs to be wording, I can't remember what the exact wording is. I thought I counted for that because if there's no record, you can't blame a guy for not putting it on the desert.

25:09.180 --> 25:12.180
That's what you're saying, right? Yeah.

25:12.180 --> 25:24.180
And then as my follow up, I think that this idea of these audits are incredibly helpful, but I do know that academia or pharma may also be interested in this in order to improve outcomes.

25:24.180 --> 25:31.180
My question would be that if those four audit roles are not filled with private individuals or both the public.

25:31.180 --> 25:42.180
If opening up those to academia or to sort of pharma companies or anybody who's associated who want to get those data and perhaps improve life would be beneficial.

25:42.180 --> 25:52.180
Yeah, I don't think it needs to be statutorily included. I believe that the Department of Public Health could probably have them just sign a contractor agreement and invite them into look at the data under NDA.

25:53.180 --> 26:04.180
I don't know that what this does is it compels that the work be done for the people, but if you want to add pharma, that would be up to your HHS department.

26:04.180 --> 26:05.180
Thank you.

26:05.180 --> 26:06.180
Thanks.

26:06.180 --> 26:08.180
Other questions, Representative Nagle.

26:08.180 --> 26:14.180
Thank you for taking my question. Mr. Chairman, sorry, it's late. Thank you for taking my question.

26:15.180 --> 26:23.180
I have actually two questions. One has to do with the data that you're collecting that you want reported within such a timeframe.

26:23.180 --> 26:29.180
I mean, one of the things we know in medicine is that association doesn't necessarily imply cause.

26:29.180 --> 26:37.180
And what I'm looking at is the data that you want on a regular basis implies a number of core abilities of vaccine type things like that.

26:37.180 --> 26:42.180
I don't see type of cause of death listed in that data that's being asked for.

26:42.180 --> 26:45.180
Is that something that you would want?

26:45.180 --> 26:52.180
Whoever did the audit of the public health data. I didn't, you know, I would hope that it was the immunization registry all Medicare and Medicaid.

26:52.180 --> 27:00.180
What are they being treated for? So if somebody dies in the same day as vaccination and about half of the ones that I found were actually fentanyl overdoses.

27:00.180 --> 27:10.180
Yeah. Okay. Not, not these, but so would you blame the vaccine for that? I mean, I would because I think it affected their brains to come to suicide, but that's a stretch. Right.

27:10.180 --> 27:12.180
So what you're saying.

27:12.180 --> 27:20.180
Yeah, correlation doesn't equal causation. It's a catchphrase. We all now know it's been drilled out there in the public domain.

27:20.180 --> 27:28.180
But when you see that everybody, and this is how I found this stuff, when Cassidy, a seven year old girl in Massachusetts died, they said she died from COVID.

27:28.180 --> 27:33.180
I was like, no way. And I went and got the half a million dust certificates.

27:33.180 --> 27:42.180
And I found that it does say she died of that, but then I found a bear's record for a seven year old girl, the only girl in that time frame who was vaccinated five days before Cassidy died.

27:42.180 --> 27:45.180
And she reacted in five minutes, vomited for eight to 10 hours.

27:45.180 --> 27:52.180
They gave her a second vaccine a couple weeks later. And that one is the date of January 13, 2022.

27:52.180 --> 28:03.180
She had immediately stomach stomach pain. She had 103 degree fever. Didn't have a bowel movement for three days. And Cassidy Baraka was dead on January 18. Sorry.

28:03.180 --> 28:13.180
I'm not sure if I asked the question. Well, when I'm looking at the data that you want, there's nothing listed in there as cause of death. I mean, you have the age one, the vaccination.

28:14.180 --> 28:22.180
That certificates have cause of death. What's that? That certificates have cause of death. I know, but this is the data that you're asking the state to report.

28:22.180 --> 28:24.180
So in section.

28:24.180 --> 28:35.180
New section to public immunization death reports, you're asking for aggregate data to be sent. I didn't see anywhere where the actual causes of death were going to be included in that data.

28:35.180 --> 28:38.180
It seems to me that would be important.

28:38.180 --> 28:43.180
So the section to the early, there's multiple twos on here. Can you reference page number?

28:43.180 --> 28:49.180
My number 25 on page one, and it goes all the way to line 13 on page two or 10.

28:49.180 --> 29:00.180
Oh, yes. So correct. I didn't have cause there. Just how many people died within one day of vaccination three days, one week, three weeks, 10 weeks, 25 weeks.

29:00.180 --> 29:04.180
And the numbers are what they are just to report them to the public.

29:04.180 --> 29:09.180
I'm just curious. I'm sorry. I want to get to my other question. My other question.

29:09.180 --> 29:17.180
If you think real quick, how does it help you because you understand catcher's parabysmal it means, right? Yeah.

29:17.180 --> 29:30.180
So all of the other things being equal. If there's all of a sudden a spike in a job, then you have to investigate the public would say, darn it, you HHS of New Hampshire, we want you to investigate.

29:30.180 --> 29:34.180
And if you investigate and find they're all pulmonary embolism deaths, well, you have a problem.

29:34.180 --> 29:45.180
You figure out the cause, but if it's fentanyl and some guy fell off a cliff and a school bus got an accident and all of a sudden a bunch of kids died, you'll find out almost immediately and you'll report it to the public.

29:45.180 --> 29:56.180
But those anomalies that occur as a matter of consequence of accidents, people are going to know about, but all of a sudden pulmonary embolism deaths, you're going to know this reports it to the public.

29:56.180 --> 30:01.180
It won't create fear or panic. It'll just create the public to demand of the department.

30:01.180 --> 30:05.180
Tell us what happened, please. That's all.

30:05.180 --> 30:09.180
Can I ask a second question? Second one, you're asked about four.

30:09.180 --> 30:15.180
No, they were follow-ups on the first. This is totally different. Is it a quick one? Yeah, I think so.

30:15.180 --> 30:26.180
In terms of the audit, how you select that, I'm a little concerned about who can apply to be an auditor.

30:26.180 --> 30:34.180
For example, if I wanted to just put in my name into the lottery with no ability to analyze data, am I allowed to be one of the people?

30:34.180 --> 30:39.180
It says in there that they have to have a level of competence, so each proposal that is submitted.

30:39.180 --> 30:44.180
So you submit a proposal, the proposal has to have certain metrics like you're going to do.

30:44.180 --> 30:49.180
I don't like statistical methods with regard to epidemiology, but most of you guys do.

30:49.180 --> 30:54.180
I'm an engineer, I like waveforms and calculus and other stuff.

30:54.180 --> 30:58.180
But if somebody wants to submit a proposal, it has to have a level of competence.

30:58.180 --> 31:05.180
Not anybody can submit one, but you're going to choose the ones that get to be chosen before they get to be chosen from the lottery.

31:05.180 --> 31:09.180
It has to meet certain standards, absolutely.

31:09.180 --> 31:16.180
All the questions. Representative Karshman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being here.

31:16.180 --> 31:25.180
Can you explain why the dates of reporting are contingent upon the dates of presidential and midterm elections?

31:25.180 --> 31:33.180
Yeah, absolutely. Everything is political these days, and that is the greatest amount of avoidance you could possibly have from any political election.

31:33.180 --> 31:41.180
And if the information were to get out to one candidate and not the other, some people would rely upon it better, it would probably not be good.

31:41.180 --> 31:49.180
It wouldn't be fair. So this is the fairest way it could be. They would have a year to know about it before any election. That's why.

31:49.180 --> 31:52.180
Other questions?

31:52.180 --> 32:01.180
I'm saying no other questions. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you.

32:01.180 --> 32:05.180
I really do. Thank you very much. Thank you.

32:05.180 --> 32:18.180
Also signed up to speak, Ryan Tanian and Chowi Chowa from the Department of Health and Human Services.

32:18.180 --> 32:29.180
All right, good afternoon again. I'm Dr. Ryan Tanian Bureau Chief of the Bureau of Infectious Disease Control.

32:29.180 --> 32:35.180
I'm joined by Chowi Chowa, who is our Bureau Chief for the Bureau of Public Health Statistics and Informatics.

32:35.180 --> 32:43.180
And we are here today to speak in opposition to House Bill 1661.

32:43.180 --> 32:55.180
As you know, House Bill 661 if enacted would amend RSA 5c 64 a to require death certificates issued in New Hampshire to include immunization records.

32:55.180 --> 33:03.180
But sourced solely from individuals who are participating in the New Hampshire immunization information system.

33:03.180 --> 33:13.180
The proposed legislation also has specific immunization data elements reporting requirements. And as others have spoken already, some independent audit reports.

33:14.180 --> 33:25.180
So first House Bill 1661 conflicts with RSA 141 C 20 F Roman numeral five, which outlines the allowable use for N HIS information.

33:25.180 --> 33:32.180
Under current law allowable uses include ensuring participants receive recommended immunizations in a timely manner.

33:32.180 --> 33:43.180
Facilitating reminders or notices to participants when due for recommended immunizations and assisting in identifying individuals who may require immunizations during disease outbreaks.

33:43.180 --> 33:55.180
So limitations on the use of participant information were established for the protection of privacy and expanding this use is outlined in House Bill 1661 would not be considered allowable.

33:56.180 --> 34:12.180
House Bill 1661 also conflicts with RSA 141 C 20 F Roman numeral VI subsection F and administrative rule HEP 30704, which is related to authorized access to NHIS.

34:12.180 --> 34:25.180
So authorized access is limited to administering current and former health care providers, the division of public health services with limited access provided to schools, child care agencies and local health departments.

34:25.180 --> 34:37.180
Under the current statute and rule, not all persons who may medically certify a death record, such as the medical examiner are authorized unrestricted access to the NHIS.

34:37.180 --> 34:49.180
So the department believes that broadly granting unrestricted access to any person who can certify a death certificate could be costly and present privacy and security concerns.

34:49.180 --> 34:57.180
If enacted, we would require additional safeguards to protect participant information from potential unauthorized access.

34:57.180 --> 35:06.180
Additionally, House Bill 1606 from the 2022 session amended NHIS to be an opt in and voluntary registry.

35:06.180 --> 35:17.180
So as a result immunizations immunization records of persons who did not voluntarily choose to participate in the registry could not be included as part of their death certificate.

35:17.180 --> 35:25.180
So other immunization records that are not contained in the IIS may be omitted or would be unavailable.

35:25.180 --> 35:36.180
And those include medical records, medical records of persons who have opted out or withdrawn their information from the registry or those who have received immunizations outside of New Hampshire.

35:36.180 --> 35:51.180
So because the legislation does not require other sources of immunization records to be included as part of a death certificate, this legislation is establishing a bias standard for NHIS participants when compared to non participants of the registry.

35:52.180 --> 36:03.180
So functionally information in the IIS may be incomplete or potentially incompatible to align with death certificates processed by the Division of Vital Records Administration.

36:03.180 --> 36:12.180
Data in the NHIS would be considered incomplete for the purpose of vital record standards as it may be self reported.

36:12.180 --> 36:27.180
It could and also be changed by the participant. So unlike for vital records NHIS does not require the use of a participant's legal name permanent address or contain other identifiers such as a driver's license or social security number.

36:27.180 --> 36:41.180
So the department is concerned that the information between the two systems could not correspond to the exact death certificate placing a burden and liability on the person certifying the death certificate.

36:41.180 --> 36:55.180
And then lastly the department we use a robust contract and procurement process to facilitate audits, selecting an auditor through a random lottery would bypass well established competitively bid and thorough vetting process.

36:55.180 --> 37:06.180
So the department uses a minimum necessary approach when granting access to data sets containing personally identifiable information or information technology platforms.

37:06.180 --> 37:16.180
And we believe that house bill 161 would weaken measures currently in place to protect and maintain the integrity of these data and patient information.

37:16.180 --> 37:24.180
And this language does not set forth clear standards certifications or qualifications of the persons or organizations conducting such audits.

37:24.180 --> 37:36.180
So in summary, the department is opposed to house bill 161 due to the data limitations potential and compatibilities of the data sets as it relates to death certificates.

37:36.180 --> 37:45.180
And we believe that there's also a undue burden placed on the persons who are medically certifying the certificates and we would be happy to answer any questions.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.180
Thank you. Representative Weber.

37:48.180 --> 37:52.180
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you very much for taking my question.

37:52.180 --> 38:03.180
I just had a question on your written testimony. Was that submitted through the system or was it because I haven't seen it and maybe I just missed it because I wasn't here at the very beginning.

38:03.180 --> 38:08.180
Thank you for the question. It was submitted.

38:08.180 --> 38:22.180
Could you very kindly in the future also submit it in print copy for those of us who keep our records in print.

38:22.180 --> 38:30.180
It would be really helpful and I didn't catch any of those citations and I'm the person who likes citations. So that would be helpful.

38:30.180 --> 38:31.180
Absolutely. Thank you.

38:31.180 --> 38:36.180
And there have been issues with the submission system in the past.

38:37.180 --> 38:44.180
Representative Missouri. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for taking my questions. My question. I might have one more.

38:44.180 --> 38:56.180
Is DHHS as alarmed as a lot of many other people regarding the amount of sudden deaths, turbo cancers, etc.

38:56.180 --> 39:01.180
That have been happening ever since the COVID vaccine has been released.

39:01.180 --> 39:08.180
Is that on your radar? Are you alarmed at all by it? Is it anything you're going to be looking into or think you should be?

39:08.180 --> 39:15.180
Thank you for the question. So, DHHS, where we are specifically in the Division of Public Health Services.

39:15.180 --> 39:25.180
We, when we look at depth data, it is based on what is reported through the vital record system and the death certificates.

39:25.180 --> 39:30.180
We wouldn't necessarily look at anything beyond that unless there was a concern.

39:30.180 --> 39:39.180
And as far as deaths reported related to vaccines that is reported through the VAERS vaccine adverse event reporting system,

39:39.180 --> 39:45.180
which can can be done by medical professionals, but it can also be done by anyone and it's also self reported.

39:46.180 --> 40:02.180
Yep. So, um, the amount of sudden deaths and also the ages of the people as to where this is happening that you're saying that this isn't hasn't just spiked an alarm that.

40:02.180 --> 40:09.180
Hey, maybe this is something we should look at because this person is 27 year old, 27 years old. This person's a teenager.

40:09.180 --> 40:17.180
Myocarditis, all of that, like this is all just, I mean, anyone right now can look around and see what's happening.

40:17.180 --> 40:31.180
So, the fact that is DHHS, are you at all forming any kind of committee or anything to look into this and to what's happening?

40:31.180 --> 40:33.180
Is that on your radar?

40:34.180 --> 40:43.180
Yeah, I follow record. My name is Joshua Chaola, CHIAH UI, CHA WLA. I'm the bureau chief of public health statistic informatic.

40:43.180 --> 40:51.180
So, on the division of public health services, we do publish aggregate data on our data system.

40:51.180 --> 40:56.180
Right now, the most current one, I believe is 2022.

40:56.180 --> 41:09.180
We are waiting for the final confirmation from the most recent year data from those data portal, as well as the statistic reported that we relays based on the program needs.

41:09.180 --> 41:25.180
We do focus on certain indicators. Just before this, this hearing, I have my staff to look into the most current that's certificate data to see if there is any vaccine causing adverse effect.

41:26.180 --> 41:36.180
This tribal records using ICD-10 code. So, WHO does have ICD-10 code for COVID-19 vaccine, which is U12.9.

41:36.180 --> 41:43.180
We look at that data, this code, excuse me, the ICD codes against the divide record data.

41:44.180 --> 41:59.180
We found no record that has the, we found no record that, you know, related to those ICD-10 codes that we're looking to that related to the vaccine adverse effect.

41:59.180 --> 42:06.180
So, we do look into different kind of a topic for the reporting purpose.

42:07.180 --> 42:16.180
And I'm sorry, just, I just want to emphasize that this bill will amend the RSA 5C64A.

42:16.180 --> 42:22.180
This is under division of vital records and administration, which is under the secretary of state.

42:22.180 --> 42:33.180
So, New Hampshire is the only stated that the vital records statistic reporting system or vital records statistic data system not under health department in the nation.

42:34.180 --> 42:42.180
So, to amend this part, we will need to work with the division of vital records and administration if the, if the bill is in act.

42:42.180 --> 42:51.180
And I believe that the division of vital records and administration also submit a written testimony as far as we were told.

42:51.180 --> 42:56.180
Representative Leon, and then Representative Webber, I think you're going to hear this, please.

42:56.180 --> 42:58.180
I'm going to speak on a little bit.

42:58.180 --> 42:59.180
Okay.

43:00.180 --> 43:04.180
Can I ask one follow up question to representative resort and then ask my questions.

43:04.180 --> 43:08.180
The first question was about the ICD-10 codes for the COVID vaccination.

43:08.180 --> 43:20.180
Are those only for people who have been vaccinated in a doctor's office or would that also capture those who are going to a drugstore or some other location that's not a doctor's office for that administration.

43:21.180 --> 43:35.180
The ICD-10 codes that I just mentioned is based on the birth certificate on the cause of death description and also the ICD code that transferred from the birth certificate.

43:36.180 --> 43:45.180
So, this will be certified by the either medical examiner or their certifiers to fill out this form.

43:45.180 --> 43:54.180
So, this part of information, I'm not in the best position to answer how this is a certified, how that certificate is a certified.

43:54.180 --> 44:04.180
But the ICD-10 code is based on our search through all the ICD-10 mortality codes that are related or has vaccine as a key word.

44:04.180 --> 44:16.180
We use that as our very roughly just have a fresh look and to search those codes in the vital record that certificate database.

44:16.180 --> 44:26.180
And we found no records related to vaccine adverse efforts based on our current database that we have access to.

44:26.180 --> 44:28.180
That's another follow up.

44:28.180 --> 44:33.180
My next my my actual question that I was initially trying to ask.

44:33.180 --> 44:40.180
I know that we've seen the VAERS data and there's been a lot of skepticism about the applicability of the VAERS data.

44:40.180 --> 44:51.180
I'd like to know how you view self reported information such as the VAERS database as opposed to more population based record keeping how in Sweden we're able to look with.

44:51.180 --> 44:57.180
They have a lot of information on their population and their health and there's a lot of population based data.

44:57.180 --> 45:07.180
Would having this information including a recognition for those patients who have no IIS record and therefore it's not a zero entry.

45:07.180 --> 45:08.180
It's a null entry.

45:08.180 --> 45:20.180
Give us something that is more meaningful than VAERS even if we're not able to reach the sweetest registry model to look at look at case matched people and see if there is a signal of risk here in New Hampshire.

45:20.180 --> 45:22.180
Or a signal of no risk quite frankly.

45:22.180 --> 45:24.180
Practically this could be done.

45:24.180 --> 45:34.180
However, we won't we are worried about the data limitation and data quality, particularly in our new Hampshire info immunization information system.

45:34.180 --> 45:35.180
Excuse me.

45:35.180 --> 45:43.180
Like Dr. Tenion address that NIH is is upping and self report voluntary system.

45:43.180 --> 45:48.180
So some identifiers such as names and address.

45:48.180 --> 45:51.180
We we don't validate that.

45:51.180 --> 46:01.180
So in order to link back to our in order to link back to the vital record that certificate data, it probably won't have the one on one match.

46:01.180 --> 46:03.180
It will be very fuzzy match.

46:03.180 --> 46:16.180
In that sense to identify how many you know to make some connection between those two systems would be a little bit risky and the result may not be really meaningful in a statistic standpoint.

46:16.180 --> 46:22.180
But we are happy to look into and maybe do some proof of concept.

46:22.180 --> 46:27.180
However, this will have a further discussion later on.

46:28.180 --> 46:35.180
So I recognize that there are some that are not going to be able to meet match to the registry.

46:35.180 --> 46:49.180
If out of 100 deaths, 10, let's say only 25% of them had have valid entries with which to compare with the IIS in which you either have records of vaccination or no records of vaccination.

46:50.180 --> 47:06.180
Is there value to be able to case match those individuals to look and see if there is either a signal of risk to the people of New Hampshire or to say that we have case match and we are not seeing any indication of higher mortality after these vaccinations and to start rebuilding

47:06.180 --> 47:10.180
that trust that's so desperately needed.

47:10.180 --> 47:19.180
Again, based on the data system quality and limitation, we don't recommend to do so.

47:19.180 --> 47:29.180
Until we have really comprehensive IIS system established and data points are all validated, then we can perform that.

47:30.180 --> 47:49.180
Right now, we can look into the vital records that certificate the data set and using the cause of that description and also ICD code to identify how many people, you know, certified with this were certified under this type of cause of death and produce that the result.

47:49.180 --> 48:07.180
And in fact, divisional vital records, they do have never an HVRI and statistic reporting system query system available for all the public, you know, users to be able to query for the underlying cause of death.

48:08.180 --> 48:21.180
That part does not really connect it to any IIS system or vaccine data, but to understand the overall cause of death, that would be the entry point for us to use as well.

48:21.180 --> 48:27.180
I don't think I don't think I answer all your question and sorry if I missed part of the question.

48:27.180 --> 48:31.180
However, maybe you can describe on the IIS limitation.

48:31.180 --> 48:41.180
Yeah, if I may, you know, sharing an example of, you know, some of the limitations as we spoke to earlier, for example, with the IIS system.

48:41.180 --> 48:45.180
There's no requirement to have say a legal name.

48:45.180 --> 48:50.180
So someone named William could be in there as Bill or Susan is in there as Sue.

48:51.180 --> 49:10.180
So it places a tremendous burden on the certifier of the death certificate to have to go through all the, you know, hundreds or thousands of records in IIS to ensure that the person they're associating an immunization record to matches someone's legal information that's contained in the death certificate.

49:10.180 --> 49:15.180
I respectfully, I think you're overthinking that part, but I know that's your job. So thank you.

49:15.180 --> 49:17.180
Representative Shapiro.

49:17.180 --> 49:19.180
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

49:19.180 --> 49:41.180
So I might have this all wrong, but when the medical examiner is determining the cause of death and writing a report, do they do they take into consideration available medical records or interviews with families that might get some light on whether there's a correlation with a recent

49:41.180 --> 49:43.180
examination?

49:43.180 --> 49:51.180
Thank you for the question, but I don't believe we're in a position to speak for the office of the chief medical examiner and their processes.

49:51.180 --> 49:52.180
Okay.

49:52.180 --> 49:53.180
Thank you.

49:53.180 --> 49:56.180
Other questions representative question.

49:56.180 --> 50:00.180
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for taking my question.

50:00.180 --> 50:08.180
So even if we can't cross match every death certificate to every record in the VAERS.

50:08.180 --> 50:10.180
I'm sorry, IIS.

50:10.180 --> 50:24.180
We would still be able to, if there were a significant climb in a certain, say it was a cytokine storm was a cause of death that all of a sudden had increased fourfold in this system.

50:24.180 --> 50:35.180
And then those, there might be people who aren't in the system, or who, or who you couldn't cross reference with.

50:35.180 --> 50:40.180
But you'd still have the signal there with the data that you had.

50:40.180 --> 50:43.180
Correct.

50:43.180 --> 50:53.180
Yeah, radically. Yes. However, practically, you know, I as has some specific use and access restricted by the law.

50:53.180 --> 51:00.180
So for myself, I don't have access to I as I have access to vital record because I'm the data steward.

51:00.180 --> 51:07.180
But I don't have access to buy I as so in order for us to do so, like what Dr. Tennian address.

51:07.180 --> 51:18.180
We will need to look into the statue on how who can access to both vital records and I as in order to do perform that kind of work.

51:18.180 --> 51:21.180
But back to the data analysis and statistical.

51:22.180 --> 51:31.180
One of the missions that the division of public health services has is really to provide meaningful data to the public.

51:31.180 --> 51:44.180
We try to be transparent as much as possible without violating any privacy and protecting the confidentiality that is our mission and goal to provide this kind of meaningful data.

51:44.180 --> 52:03.180
So, you know, if the data set is not really comparable or is not really has lots of limitation. We really don't want to perform that kind of analysis and deliver the reported that may not be validated.

52:03.180 --> 52:11.180
Oh, so it sounds like the department admits that there are faults with the.

52:11.180 --> 52:19.180
Their system and that it's not adequate to perhaps make determinations on these things.

52:19.180 --> 52:31.180
And so it sounds like we could have an amendment to bolster our ability to surveil these things in New Hampshire with the department be willing to help us write an amendment to grant those permissions.

52:32.180 --> 52:37.180
Yeah, so thank you for the question.

52:37.180 --> 52:42.180
We would say that there's limitations with the various system.

52:42.180 --> 52:49.180
You know, just as there are limitations here, we would be open to looking at any proposed amendments.

52:50.180 --> 52:52.180
Senator McLean.

52:52.180 --> 53:04.180
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for taking my question. Sorry. I came in late. I was testifying on another bill, but just does the does the medical examiner who is writing up the death certificate.

53:04.180 --> 53:11.180
I know that the IIS is an opt in, but do they have access to look at the IIS.

53:11.180 --> 53:17.180
Thank you for the question. So currently the medical examiner does not have access to the IIS.

53:18.180 --> 53:25.180
So at a minimum, I'm sorry, Mr. Quick follow up. So at a minimum, we would need to grant them access in order to go anywhere.

53:27.180 --> 53:36.180
As we interpret the bill, it looks like we would have to grant anyone who can medically certify a death certificate access to the IIS. Thank you.

53:37.180 --> 53:49.180
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for taking my question. For me, it looks like 22. So we have people who write the certificates.

53:49.180 --> 53:58.180
They wonder why this occurred and then you use the code to look if something happened.

53:58.180 --> 54:15.180
For example, last year, Dr Benjamin Chan, testified for the HHS that COVID-19 vaccines indeed cause increased myocarditis in certain geometry in certain populations.

54:15.180 --> 54:33.180
So, but before that, like for a while, it was pushed on public. It pushed on medical examiners that vaccine related myocarditis is medical misinformation.

54:33.180 --> 54:40.180
People were losing their licenses for even mentioning it. So of course, they were not putting those codes.

54:40.180 --> 54:52.180
I see 10 codes because they didn't want to say that it cost for vaccine. I didn't know. They didn't know better what stops the heart of a young boy.

54:52.180 --> 55:01.180
So you wouldn't look at that death because it's not on the court and the court wouldn't be there because they were said it's not happening.

55:01.180 --> 55:16.180
So my understanding is that we need something like this bill, like to try to came out from this catch 22 situation. Could you comment?

55:16.180 --> 55:21.180
I'm sorry. Could you actually state what the question was?

55:21.180 --> 55:50.180
So, besides this enacting this bill, how we fix this situation when you only look in vaccine related deaths, if it's already listed as vaccine related deaths and don't investigate, for example, if boys are dying from myocarditis in 2021, nobody would put it as vaccine related death.

55:50.180 --> 55:55.180
So you would never look into it. So how do we fix this situation?

55:55.180 --> 56:03.180
Thank you for the question. But I think it goes back to a comment I had spoken to earlier.

56:03.180 --> 56:17.180
The office of the chief medical examiner and those processes are separate from the department and the department isn't necessarily in a place to validate or verify the information that

56:18.180 --> 56:26.180
persons who are certified or persons who are eligible to certify a death certificate place on there.

56:26.180 --> 56:29.180
Other questions.

56:29.180 --> 56:40.180
Okay, I think we're all set. Thank you. Thank you.

56:40.180 --> 56:55.180
Also signed up to speak as Ben Bradley from the New Hampshire Hospital Association.

56:55.180 --> 57:07.180
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Ben Bradley, Vice President State Government Relations for the New Hampshire Hospital Association, representing all the state's community hospitals and specialty hospitals in New Hampshire.

57:07.180 --> 57:24.180
The hospital association is opposed to HB 1661 and has several concerns with the bill, which would require additional steps for providers to comply with RSA 5-C colon 64 medical certification of the death record.

57:24.180 --> 57:37.180
This would include emergency room doctors, physician assistants, advanced practice registered nurses, and long term care providers among others who may certify death certificates, so not just the medical examiner or the state.

57:37.180 --> 57:53.180
Current statute states, quote, the medical certification on the death record shall be completed by the attending physician APRN or physician assistant or certifying physician APRN or physician assistant and made available to the funeral

director next of kin or designated agent as soon as possible, but no later than 36 hours after the time of death.

58:02.180 --> 58:18.180
We're concerned the language in HB 1661 would create delays to medical certification of death records given the requirements in this bill to include additional data elements from the New Hampshire Immunization Information System.

58:18.180 --> 58:29.180
This bill would also require access to and training on the use of the NIH IIS, which is not currently afforded to all providers who may certify death certificates.

58:29.180 --> 58:43.180
Additionally, providers would be responsible and likely liable for positively identifying a New Hampshire IIS participant is the same individual they are certifying in a death record.

58:43.180 --> 58:52.180
This could be particularly challenging as the IIS does not include identifiers that would be needed to confirm the patient's identity.

58:52.180 --> 58:56.180
Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on this bill.

58:56.180 --> 59:01.180
We remain opposed and respectfully request the committee, the bill.

59:01.180 --> 59:03.180
I'm happy to answer your questions.

59:03.180 --> 59:07.180
Thank you. Any questions?

59:07.180 --> 59:08.180
Seeing none.

59:08.180 --> 59:09.180
Okay. Thank you.

59:09.180 --> 59:11.180
Sorry.

59:11.180 --> 59:13.180
Sorry.

59:13.180 --> 59:15.180
It's probably this pink card.

59:15.180 --> 59:17.180
Nobody brought the police.

59:17.180 --> 59:19.180
Do you have any questions?

59:19.180 --> 59:20.180
I don't know.

59:20.180 --> 59:21.180
I don't know.

59:21.180 --> 59:35.180
Okay.

59:35.180 --> 59:39.180
Again, thank you, Mr. Bradley.

59:39.180 --> 59:46.180
Before I close this public hearing, I have no one else signed up to testify on HB 1661.

59:46.180 --> 59:52.180
I do want to just read those who signed in expressing support and opposition.

59:52.180 --> 59:58.180
Let's see.

59:58.180 --> 01:00:06.180
Nine people signed up to indicate support for this bill to sign up to oppose this bill.

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:11.180
That is those who were not going to be testifying today.

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:13.180
And I have the online.

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.180
Okay.

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.180
And what's the online?

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:20.180
And online, there were 155 in support and 37 against and one neutral.

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.180
Okay.

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:25.180
Having no one else signed up to speak today.
