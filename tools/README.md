# Tools (and Notes)
Most of the time we will be using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download the appearances. If there are any other tricks involved, they may be noted here or the respective README.md files of each stream.

Typical command:
```yt-dlp --write-link --write-auto-subs --write-subs https://path.to/appearance```

AI Captions are generated with [Whisper AI](https://github.com/openai/whisper) (usually base.en model).
